How about your psychological resilience ?
I think I can work well under pressure , if necessary .
How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ?
I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way .
You seem to be a kind-hearted lady .
Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature .
Please tell me your weaknesses if you can .
I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection .
I'm the Project Manager so I have to make sure our projects run smoothly . I work with three Project Engineers . They take care of after-sales service and look after the maintenance side of the business .
I'm sorry - it's my fault . I was filling the bathtub and I left the water running too long , so it overflowed .
That's OK . As long as you clean it up .
You can come back in twenty minutes , and it will be ready .
If I couldn ' t wait , could the prescription be mailed to me ?
Yes , you can have it delivered or filled at any location in our HMO .
When should I take this medication ?
You need to take it at bedtime .
Should I take this medicine on an empty stomach ?
Don ' t mix alcohol with this medication , but you can take it with or without food .
What are the side effects of this medication ?
You might feel a little dizzy at first , but it should pass .
I'm afraid I can't .
Why ?
Well , my car won't start . I don't know what's the matter with it .
Could it be the battery ?
No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago . It must be other problems .
Well , I suppose it could be the gas .
No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday .
Perhaps it's the starter then ?
Yes , that's possible .
I had some bread for breakfast .
Let's go out for brunch .
Brunch ?
It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also .
Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch .
Ok , what do you want me to do ?
First of all , I need you to do the drying up . I ' m almost finished the washing up . I ' m going to clean the cooker when I finish .
Ok . I ' ll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them . Where is the tea towel ? Oh , here it is .
We ' ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it .
While you ' re cleaning the cooker , I ' ll wipe the worktop . That was a great meat , by the way .
Actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it .
My pleasure ! This tea towel ' s a little ragged . Do you have another one ?
Yes . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out .
Keep it and use it as rag . You can clean your bicycle with it .
Yes , I'd like to settle my bill .
Certainly sir . May I have your room key , please ?
Sure . Here you are .
Just a moment , please . I'll draw up your bill for you ... Thank you for waiting , sir . Your bill totals two thousand six hundred and fifty-eight yuan , including the phone and laundry .
That much ! Would you mind letting me have a look at it ?
Not at all , sir . Here you are .
Thanks . Well , It seems to be right . How much is that in dollars , please ?
Just a moment , sir . I'll calculate that for you . It comes to 305 dollars and 52 cents at today's exchange rate .
I see . OK .
How would you like to make the payment ?
In cash , please . Here you are .
Thank you , sir ... Here is your change . Could you check it , please ? Thank you for choosing our hotel . I hope you enjoyed your stay .
By the way , please forward my mail to this address .
Certainly , sir . We hope you have a good trip .
As I have some administrative experience from my last job , I may use my organizational and planning skills in the future .
How do you plan to accomplish this ?
By doing everything necessary and for further study .
How long would you like to stay with this company ?
How long I will stay with the company depends on whether the company and I are satisfied with each other .
What do you think of this industry's outlook in five years ?
I do believe this industry will be developed rapidly in 5 years time .
I am so glad they called you . It feels like something is really wrong with my stomach !
Does it hurt when I push here ?
It ' s mostly on my right side . Right here !
Have you been feeling this way for awhile ?
I started feeling kind of sick last night after dinner , but this morning the pain got really bad !
Have you eaten anything unusual lately ?
No , not that I remember .
We are going to take you to an emergency room right now .
I will feel better when I know what the problem is . Thank you for the drugs .
Hello , Mr . Henderson what can I do for you ?
I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP !
OK , I can have it ready by the end of the week .
No , you don ' t understand , I need this tomorrow morning ! I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ' s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! She ' s gonna kill me !
OK , I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon , but this suit is also very stained . I can ' t guarantee we can remove it completely .
Fine ! Can you also iron and starch this shirt ?
Certainly .
Great ! This is our secret ! If you see my wife , say nothing to her about this !
Good coming . I would like to open a new account . I want to deposit 500 dollars .
Very good , sir . What kind would you like ?
Could you tell me how many kinds there are in your bank ?
Besides the checking account , there's a monthly savings account and a daily interest account .
Oh , I think I'd like to take the monthly savings account then .
Would you fill out this form ?
OK . Here you are .
All right . And here's your deposit book .
Thank you . Goodbye .
Goodbye .
All right . Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here .
Let's buy some tickets .
The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train
Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ?
No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them .
Yes . I'm looking for an apartment , I'd like two bedrooms .
All right . Have a seat , please . Let me ask you a few questions . First of all , may I have your name , please ?
My name's Donald Eakins .
How do you spell your last name , Mr . Eakins .
It's E-A-K-I-N-S .
E-A-K-I-N-S . First name , Donald . And what's your present address , Mr . Eakins ?
It's 1446 Pine Street .
1446 Pine . That's in San Francisco , isn't it ?
Yes , it is .
Are you on a tourist visa or a student visa ?
Student visa .
What is the reason for extension ?
I'll go into a practical training as soon as I receive my Master ' s degree from the University of Pennsylvania early next month .
We ' ll need a letter from your university and a financial statement from you .
No , there's no such section . The dairy section is where you'll find milk and cheese .
What's Condiments ?
That's where you'll find things like salt and pepper .
Oh , I see .
Let's go to aisle 4 to pick up some pasta for tonight .
Great ! Pasta for dinner .
And let's get a loaf of bread at the bakery for breakfast .
Maybe we should get a shopping cart .
I'll put the shopping basket back .
From the numbers , it seems like Forest Inc . is our digest competitor ... Le'Ban and Markford are also major contenders in our market .
Le'Ban is the new kid on the block , it's amazing they've had such tremendous success so soon ... With them on the scene , the competition is outthrough .
here's information about our competitor's recent market activities ...
Thanks , this will be a big help in putting together next quarter's marketing strategies . With competition this intense , we'll have to step up production even more . We need a price we can compete with .
We're in a very competitive environment . It's sink or saimin this market .
Better start swimming ! we've got to find a way to outsmart the other guys . I want a preliminarily strategic marketing plan on my desk by next Tuesday ... the competition never sleeps and neither should we .
Good morning . This is Paul Alexander calling from the Isis Advertising Firm . We need a car to the airport for Mr . Phillips .
Certainly , Mr . Alexander . When would Mr . Phillips like to leave ?
Let me check ... His flight ' s at 2:30 p . m . , so he should leave no later than 12 noon .
Mr . Thomas , this is a standard size .
Can you supply us right away ?
Yes , we have plenty on hand right now .
Good , we'll take 500 suits .
OK , thanks for the order .
Yes . We need a plumber here .
I am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager .
I am sorry . They are not available now .
Yes . Can I help you ?
Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago .
Of course I remember you .
I think I lost my wallet here .
Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything .
Really ? You didn't find a wallet ?
No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ?
Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor . Has anyone sat at this table since we left ?
No . It's been empty the whole time .
Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened .
I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill . You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ?
No . My friend did .
Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ?
No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down . It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table .
Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home .
I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house . But what should I do ?
Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home . Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that .
Should I call the police ?
You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets .
Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home .
I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir .
Thanks for your help .
I would like to order 2 office-style cabinets and desk calendars . We want office-style cabinets in white . The catalogue number is 90 - f - 2356 .
How soon do you want it ?
Could you deliver it tomorrow ?
No problem .
Please handle the items carefully .
Certainly .
We will pay by collect on delivery .
OK . What ?
It isn't gratitude . It's fear . Vince is afraid I'll jump to a competitor .
You wouldn't do that . Would you ?
I might . Vince knows he needs to keep me happy .
What about your accounts ?
There's an airsickness bag behind the seat that's in front of you .
I must've missed it .
Is this your first time flying ?
Yes . I'm going to San Francisco .
Oh , it's a beautiful city . I think you'll like it .
Hey , I'm feeling much better already .
Sometimes if you don't think about it , that sick feeling will go away on its own .
Thanks . By the way , my name is Mary .
I'm Frank . Nice to meet you .
Good morning . Could you tell me where I can find the Clothing Department ?
On the left of the elevator of the 3rd floor .
I ' d like to buy a woolen vest for my grandpa .
I ' m sure you can find your favorite there .
Thank you very much .
It ' s my honor .
Well , let's see . Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time .
Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired .
Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies .
Oh , we always go to the movies . Can't we do something different ?
Well , do you have any suggestions ?
Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ?
It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things .
Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
OK .
Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ?
Actually , I learn many things from it . I find that I am a quick learner in new things .
Practice makes perfect . By the way , what do you learn from your job ?
At first I didn't know anything about the machine . Now I know how to operate it . Besides , the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement .
Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance .
Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job .
I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work .
OK , let's go .
Yes , sir . Just a minute , please , I'll check with the kitchen .
Thank you for waiting . It takes another ten to fifteen minutes , I'm afraid .
We have an appointment in half an hour .
I see .
Do you have anything else I can have instead ?
Well , yes . How about beef stew ? We can serve you at once .
I'll take beef stew , then .
The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street .
How long will it take me to get there ?
It's about a ten-minute walk .
That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .
Not at all .
Really , it's so beautiful .
You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you .
You mustn't pick it in this place .
Where it is ?
It's a private garden .
There is one . 5 blocks away from here ?
Well , that's too far . Can you change some money for me ?
Surely , of course . What kind of currency have you got ?
RIB .
How much would you like to change ?
1000 Yuan . Here you are .
Yes . Is there anything you can give me to get rid of it , doctor ?
I'm going to prescribe some antibiotics and some cream to ease the itching and burning .
Ok , thank you ! Where should I buy them ?
The pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic .
Great ! What floor is pharmacy on ?
The fourth . I'll send the prescription down there so you can just pick it up on your way out .
Thank you !
Yes , sir . Please examine it .
Anything subject to duty in your suitcase ?
No , sir . Nothing except my personal belongings , such as clothes , notebooks and some gifts .
Any cigarettes or liquor ?
I have cigarettes for my own use .
I think you'll have to pay some duty on these cigarettes because they exceed the quota . And this article is liable for duty .
How much duty should I pay ?
One hundred dollars .
Here is the money .
Just a moment . I'll make out your duty memo . ( Writing and giving the memo to Mr . Green ) Take it and pay the girl over there .
Thank you .
I ' m looking for a hotel near the convention center .
You ' re in luck ! We ' re just a two-minute drive from there . Would you like to make a reservation ?
Not just yet . I have one or two questions . How much for a single ?
During the peak season , a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night . But we ' Ve got a Single Super Saver Special going on right now -- only $ 30 a night . And we ' Ve also extended our checkout time 00 in
That ' s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients .
Yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . We can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . Of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking
That sounds great . Do you accept checks ?
I ' m sorry , sir , we don ' t . But we do accept all major credit cards .
I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ' t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ?
Do you mind I have a look at your computer ?
Of course not , I appreciate that .
Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity .
I see . What can I do now ?
You can send a compressed one .
I'm ready now . I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn .
And would you like an appetizer before your meal ? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup .
I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad .
Can I get you anything to drink ?
Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea .
Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
Thank you .
Hi , Deborah ! This is John . I'm calling from Australia .
What are you doing in Australia ?
I'm attending a conference in Sydney this week . Remember ?
Oh , right . What time is it there ?
It's 10:00 P . M . And it's four o'clock in Los Angeles , right ?
Yes - four o'clock in the morning .
4:00 A . M . ? I'm really sorry .
That's OK . I'm awake now .
How can there be a traffic jam on a 16 - lane highway every day ?
There are just too many people , and too many cars .
I wonder if there was an accident .
No , they just said it too many people were trying to get off at the Capitol exits .
Well , let ' s put on some music . We ' re going to be stuck in this for a while .
All right , what do you want to listen to ?
How about some Beatles ?
Yeah , all right .
Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks .
You ' re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later .
This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ?
The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ' t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do .
Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ?
Of course , you have . You must try harder this time .
And must I go back to school ?
No , you needn ' t do that . You ' d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes .
But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ' m nearly 17 .
You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ' t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study .
What else I ' Ve got to do ? Join the army ?
Who knows ! That might come to later .
Yes , I need to check-in for the eleven 20 flight to New York , please .
O . K . Ticket , please .
Here you are .
Would you like a window or an aisle seat , Mr . Smith ?
I want an aisle seat as close to the exit door as possible , please .

Here you are , seat 12c . Please go to gate 23 after passing through the security checkpoint .
Thank you .
Have a nice day .
You , too .
How about taking a walk in the park ?
OK . It ' s delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh .
( After they enter the park ) Oh , it's so quiet here . We have the park to ourselves , only you and me !
Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your left .
Oh , I see them . Some are doing Taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the Chinese Wushu .
A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China .

OK . What kind of room do you want ? We have single rooms , twin rooms , double rooms and suites available on Friday .
I want a single room with ocean view . Do you have one ?
Let me check . Yes .
OK . I will take it .

OK . No problem .
Checking out , please .
Can I have your keys , please ? Thank you . Here's your statement .
Excuse me . What are these charges ?
Oh , these are the phone charges and these are for something from the bar .
Wait a minute . I made a phone call , but I never made a connection .
I know , sir . Those aren't telephone company charges . Those are hotel charges .
Isn't that a bit excessive ?
I'm sorry , sir . It's our policy .
OK . Here is the money .
Thank you . Welcome to our hotel again .
Ten more minutes , mom .
What time is it now ?
It's already 3 8 o'clock .
Well , honey , wake up , or you'll be late for school .

I'd like to meet him . Will you introduce him to me ?
OK .
It's a big bedroom with a drawing room , facing a beautiful wood .
Is there a bathroom ?
No , but there is one downstairs , which my daughter used some years ago .
It sounds good . Could I go and see it myself ?
Certainly , you're welcome anytime .
See you later !
( after a while ) Good afternoon , Mrs . Smith . I called you just now .
Welcome ! Come in , please !
Yes .
This way please . Your room is upstairs ... Here it is .
Wonderful ! A modest , comfortable room . Ah , a beautiful window , through which I can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . How nice !
Yes , if you want to wash something , there is a separate lavatory room outside .
Excellent ! I like it ! When can I move in ?
Anytime you like .
OK .
Yes , it is .

Thank you .
Not at all .
What symptoms does he have ?
He has had a fever for one day . Just now at home , he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up . We were at a loss what to do . We called an ambulance and brought the baby here .
How long did the convulsion last ?
About 3 minutes .
Does he have any other complaints ?
Three days ago , he began to cough , sneeze and have a running nose . Yesterday , he began to have a fever .
Have you taken his temperature ?
It was 38 ° C this morning and it was 39 ° C just now .
Let me examine him to see if there is any rash . No rash .
Is it serious ? Is it meningitis ?
No , it is not meningitis . Just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection .
Does he have to be admitted to hospital ?
No . No need for admission . I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . Then I will give you a prescription . The pink tablets are used for his fever . When his temperature is over 38 ° C , give him one tablet . The other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions . The white liquid is for the cold . Give the baby plenty of water to drink .
Thank you very much , doctor .
That's not a problem . Leave it with me , and find something that you like .
I was hoping you'd have something on sale today .
We have nothing on sale today . But we're having a big sale next weekend .
Is the sale going to include dresses ?
Everything you can see will be on sale .
I like the sound of that . I'll just come back next weekend .
The savings will be worth the short wait . See you next weekend .
Well , we could probably get started with a strategy meeting tomorrow morning at 8
I tell you what , 800 is no good for me , but why don ' t you guys get started and I ' ll come by at around 8
That ' s fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ?
Oh , it ' s the latest novel by Ray Blue . It ' s a sic-fi thriller .
I thought he usually wrote horror books .
He does . He ' s good at this genre too . It ' s a captivating read .
We ' re going to the bookshop . Would you like to join us ?
Yes , I would . I need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , I love browsing through the latest paperbacks .
Me too . I need something to read on the flight to New York . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ' s books for her daughter .
I want to look at nelson Mandela ' s autobiography .
This is sure to be a worthwhile read .
Yes , we have . Here's our CIF quotation sheet . Please have a careful look .
Are the prices on the list firm offers ?
Yes . All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation .
I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices .
All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ?
How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan .
I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days .
But Mom ! Today we ' re playing football ! I love football !
You ' Ve got a fever and playing football isn ' t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ' s that on your arm ?
I don ' t know . It was there when I woke up this morning .
It ' s rash . I ' d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ?
I bashed it against the chair in my room .
Does it hurt ?
A little , but not much .
Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ' ll take you to the doctor ' s after breakfast .
If I ' m better this afternoon , can I go to school ?
If you are better , but I doubt you will be .
We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ...
That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket .
I ' m all right , thanks . Just a little tired .
Late night ?
Yeah , I got home around two .
I'd like to reserve a double room . I will be arriving next Monday , the 12th . My name is Wilson .
A double room for the 12th ? The name is Wilson ?
Yes , that's right .
How long will you be staying ?
Three or four days , perhaps longer .
Very good , sir . We will be expecting you next Monday , the 12th .
No . I haven't had a chance to read the paper yet .
you've got to see it . It's an unbelievable picture !
What's so interesting about it ?
Well , this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up , half his face had been bitten off !
What ? How did that happen ?
They think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face .
Wow . What does his look like now ?
It looks pretty frightening . He doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . Most of his nose and chin are missing too .
What did he look like before his dog bit his face off ?
He was actually quite handsome . What a shame .
What's he going to do now ?
It said that he's hoping to get a face transplant , but until then , he's looking forward to Halloween so he isn't the only one wearing a mask .
Yes , I ' m here to see Joanna Stevens . I have an appointment at four .
Certainly , may I take your name ? I ' ll let her know you ' Ve arrived .
Sure , it ' s Josh O ' Neil .
Ms . Stevens will be with you momentarily . Can I offer you something to drink ?
Yes , a coffee would be nice , thank you .
Here you are . Ms . Stevens is ready for you now . I ' ll show you to her office , right this way .
Hello . I hope you can help me ; I'm a little worried about my new card .
What seems to be the problem ?
I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it .
Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ?
No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it !
You said you received your card this morning , am I right ?
Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ?
Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons .
Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me .
Yes , in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you
I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . I went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains .
How did you spend the night there ?
We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful .
I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country .
Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't ?
Yes . It is one of the Five Mountains .
I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ?
I'd love to .
Do you have any form of ID ?
I have my Tennis Club card . Is that good enough ?
I ' m afraid not . It has to be a passport or a valid driver ' s license .
Oh ... wait a minute ... here ' s my driver ' s license .
OK , just fill in this application . You can sit over there . This brochure explains our services . We have free checking , and you will be given a debit card and on ATM card . There is no service
OK , I ' ll fill out the form and come right back .
It can ' t be time to get up yet .
It is . Hurry up ! You ' ll be late for school .
What ' s the time ?
It ' s nearly half past seven .
My watch says ten past .
It ' s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight .
Are you sure half past seven ?
Positive . I ' ll put the radio on .
It ' s only seven o ' clock . Your watch is fast .
No , it isn ' t . It ' s stopped . I forgot to wind it up last night .
I could have stayed in bed for another half hour .
We don't have a swimming pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in the gym .
I never heard of a swim station . Is that like a train or bus station ?
It's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against .
Holy cow ! I never heard of such a thing . How much do they cost ?
As a guest , sir , you pay nothing .
This sounds better every second . Now , when can I use the stations ?
If you want to swim , you can visit the gym any day between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m .
Oh , boy ! This is going to be great . I'm going to the gym right now !
I'm sure you'll enjoy your workout , sir . Everyone seems to like the swim stations .
Your main job is serving the clients and giving them what they want .
What other things do I need to know ?
You'd spend 30 % of your time on the computer . You may be bored with a job like that .
No problem . I am used to it .
Do you have many different suppliers ?
Yes . There are about fifty names on our approved supplier list , but for raw materials we tend to deal with three local companies .
Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ' t understand .
From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ' s overbooked .
I know what overbooked is , I just don ' t understand how that could happen ?
Actually it ' s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ' t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats ,
So who has to stay behind ?
Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone .
Ok . I ' ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket !
I know . Sorry , I shouldn't have rushed you , but I just couldn't stay at home and wait .
Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ?
Why not ? I'd love to do that .
Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art .
Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ?
Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ?
I surely do . They must have had advanced machine in ancient China to do that .
No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .
Unbelievable ! I could never do that .
Yes . Can I deposit valuables here ?
Of course , you can . Please put your articles in this bag and seal it .
OK .
Thank you . Here is your tag .
Would you tell me the rate per day for depositing my bag ?
Sure , madam . Only one dollar .
When does the cloakroom close ?
This cloakroom is open until 10 p . m .
Oh , dear ! I won't be back until about 11:30 tonight . Where can I pick up my bag ?
We will transfer your bag to the Lobby Floor Cloakroom . You may collect it there , madam .
I see . Thanks a lot .
You're welcome .
Yes , of course . When ?
Will you be free this afternoon , say from 3 to 4 ?
Now let me check my schedule ... OK , you could to my office then .
Yes , madam , how much would you like to remit ?
2,000 AD $ .
Which would you like to remit , by mail or by cable ?
What is the difference between them ?
The cable will take less time for your account , in the meantime , the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one .
Well , I think the cable is better .
OK , please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary , your name and telephone .
All right . Here you are .
Everything is OK . The commission is 50 yuan .
Here you are . Thanks a lot .
Have you chosen the material ?
Yes , I want it to made of tweed .
Fine . And the charge is $ 100 .
When will it be available ?
Next Wednesday .
Same here . I've been looking forward to this .
I ' m sorry I kept you waiting so long . I'm running a little late today .
No problem . That happens to all of us , it goes badly with the traffic .
Thank you . Can I offer you some refreshment ?
Why not , thank you . A little tea would be nice .
Sure , do you have the receipt ?
Yeah here you go . Actually I also want to return this keyboard .
Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ?
The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear .
I see , and what about the keyboard ?
I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work .
I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages .
Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways .
Thanks . It ' s nothing special actually .
Don ' t say that . It owes to your efforts and team spirit .
Oh , it was nothing . Anyone could have done it . I still have a lot to learn yet .
You are very modest . Best luck in your new position .
Thank you . I won ' t let this promotion change me .
Please I'd like a ticket to New York .
For today ?
No , early saturday morning .
We have a flight that we'll put you there at ten AM . Is that ok ?
Nothing earlier ? I prefer flight at nine thirty .
I'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight .
No , exactly not
How about afternoon ?
Sounds not good . I won't take it .
Yes . I have lost about ten kilos .
How did you do it ?
I am on a diet . And I do more exercise regularly .
What's the secret then ?
It lies in perseverance .
Well . It's hard for me . I can't keep doing exercise .
You should have a try .
Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing !
Why are they all in glass boxes ?
For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .
So there isn't air in the glass boxes ?
No , there isn't . They are all vacuumed .
I wonder how old these things are , thousands of years ?
Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time .
Hey , look at the three-leg cup . I've seen it on TV .
The bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless !
Yeah , it has no value at all . Who will use this cup today ?
Danny , priceless means so valuable that you can't put a price on it .
Oh , it does ?
Yes . I was Propaganda department minister of our university .
Did you get any honors or awards at your university ?
No . It ' s a pity about it .
Were you involved in any club activities at your university ?
Yes . I was a member of the basketball Society . I like playing basketball .
What extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ?
I sometimes played basketball and sometimes played football .
We ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained .
What ' s the result ?
We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received .
That seems very impressive . Good work !
Thank you , but I cannot take all the credit . Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level .
OK . By the way , I'd like to tell you that the check-out time is 12
I see .
Have you used any hotel services this morning or had breakfast at the hotel dining room , Mr . Green ?
Yes , my friend and I just had breakfast at the dining room , but we didn't use any services .
How about the charge for the days you shared the room with your friend ?
Please add to my account .
The total for the eight days is five hundred sixty yuan .
OK . Here you are .
OK . Let me send a memo around .
Schedule it for this afternoon , when Ken gets back .
I don ' t think he ' s back today .
Oh , that ' s right . Go ahead anyways . I ' ll fill him in . We can ' t lose this order under any circumstances !
I know , it ' s a big one .
Yes , we are on the same plane .
But I am a transfer passenger . I have a connecting flight to Miami .
So you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area .
Yes . It ' s quite troublesome .
Why not go and find a porter ?
Oh right ... you know , my friend Eric is a DJ . Maybe he would like to play with us .
Hmm ... does he have a good ear for hip hop music ?
Well , I don't know , but we can find out . We can talk to him and ask if he wants to join our group .
Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 .
Well , I am all ears . Maybe they are helpful .
Firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . And secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . The last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age .
I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it .
Good luck to us .
Yes , madam . May I help you ?
Yes . I ' m calling from Westwood and Westwood Attorneys . I need to make a reservation for Mr . Alex Brent .
Fine , madam . When will Mr . Brent be arriving , and how many nights will he be staying ?
How's this one ?
Oh , I need a small one , otherwise my luggage will be overweight .
What about this one ?
Oh , this is fine .
Good night , mum .
Good night .
Turn left at the second light . You can't miss it .
Will it take me long to get there ?
No . It's not far at all .
Thank you very much .
That's all right . Have a good day .
Yes , Mr . Ransom ? This is Karl Miller . How may I help you ?
Well , I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month . It hasn ' t arrived yet .
Certainly , Ms . Ransom . Do you have an order number ?
What would you like to speak to me about ?
I would like to talk to you about this year ' s election .
Is that right ?
I am a volunteer for this year ' s campaign .
That ' s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand .
I know history is about to be made , and I would like to be a part of it .
That ' s fantastic .
Are you planning on voting ?
I ' m going to vote .
Go to your polling place early on Election Day .
I will . Good luck with your volunteering .
I would be happy to help . What would you like me to help with , food or entertainment ?
I would like to help you with both .
That will work out fine . To make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ?
A dressy party would be fun !
That will work out fine . Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best ?
We should probably have both .
Yes , that will work out fine . Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ ?
Maybe we could do both !
Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details .
Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast !
Nice ! Brunch !
Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?
Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
Looks good ! I ' ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ' t forget the syrup !
Good morning ! I am Anna Lu . I've come for an interview which was arranged .
Oh , I see . I am Jack White , Personnel Manager . Take a seat , please .
Glad to meet you , Mr . White .
Miss Lu , have you got any experience in restaurant service ?
Yes . Since I entered college , I have been working at a fast food restaurant as a part-time waitress .
For how long ?
3 years .
Our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . Can you serve them in English ?
That's why I applied for this job . Now I am studying Hotel English in my college , and I am quite familiar with the western courtesy and restaurant etiquette . I am sure my public relation skills will leave a strong impression on your customers .
You must know our working hours are very long and overtime work is frequent .
I don't mind that .
I think I will give you a 3 months ' trial . The salary for this period is 800 yuan a month with no bonus . After that period if we both feel satisfied , a formal contract would be signed .
When am I supposed to start working ?
Next monday . Bring your resume and diploma with you .
Yes , I will . Thank you , Mr . White . Goodbye !
Goodbye !
Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it .
I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ?
Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ' t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful .
How do you think if I volunteer for some work ?
I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives .
Oh , Brian . That ' s really sweet of you guys . I would love to get together with all of you . How about Friday ?
Great ! What time ?
I ' m free all afternoon . Why don ' t we meet at 1 o ' clock in the lobby ?
Do you know various funds and accounts ?
Yes , I enjoy working with that .
Great . We have a very pleasant working condition and I think we have a fine staff to work with .
I'm sorry . Something is wrong with my taxi .
Where does it go wrong ?
Let me stop my car for check . Oh , my god . I got a flat tyre .
Can it keep going ?
Sorry . You'd better get off for taking another taxi .
Too bad . I did anyway .
No wonder you brought such a big bag today .
I brought Strawberry Sticks . See ?
Those are the ones that are pre-dipped in sweet coating !
Yep . And there's real strawberry chunks in the coating .
What's up , Bro ? What's in the bulletin ?
It says that there will be a blackout from 5 p . m . to 7 p . m . in our neighborhood today .
Blackout ? Even the TV has the limit .
Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?
Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either !
That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ?
Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner !
OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here .
How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ?
Barbie ? You know , I might be seven , but I'm not a girl .
Do you have a better plan ?
All right , all right .
It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax .
Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves .
Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
no , it's definitely my turn to treat you ... you paid last time !
oh , that was just a quick bite to eat---that doesn't count !
ok , ok , how about we just go Dutch ? It's settled . Listen , I'm still pretty new around here , would it be alright if you found the restaurant ?
ok ... sure .
Yes , we had a meting about it yesterday afternoon .
What's the answer ?
We decided that we could agree to your price , but we are a bit worried about the slow delivery .
Let me see . I quoted your delivery in three months , didn't I ?
Yes , but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible .
I thought you would be worried about it . So I rang Auckland last night . As you are our biggest customer , they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave Auckland next month .
Good , if you agree we'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then .
By all means .
All except the back door . I left that open for Tim . He took the dog for a walk .
Well , I'm going on to bed . I'm beat .
Okay . I'm going to stay up a while . I've got to go over the household budget . We're a little overspent this month .
Please tell Tim to close the door to the basement . I don't want the dog down there tonight .
Okay . Good night . See you at breakfast .
You need all your receipts for reimbursement .
You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ?
Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I ' ll get it signed for you .
I am not sleepy .
It's getting late , and you have to wake up early tomorrow .
There is no way that I can fall asleep right now .
Try listening to some soft music .
It won't work . I'm nowhere close to being tired .
I really don't care , just go to sleep .
What if I stay up and do something , until I get tired ?
You'll be up all night if I let you do that .
I'm going to get to sleep eventually .
You need to go to sleep now , so go to sleep .
Good night .
I'm looking for a bookcase , but I don't want to buy a new one .
Are you having any luck ?
Not really . There aren't any used bookcases listed . But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday . I think I'll go to them .
Do you mind if I go with you ?
Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
I learned to negotiate from my mother . I thought I was pretty good at bargaining , but I had a problem the other day at Kimble's Department Store .
What happened ?
I wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . It was priced at forty dollars , so I started by offering the salesclerk thirty .
Yes please . Do you have any teas ?
Of course we have lots of teas ?
What do you recommend ?
What about a green tea or perhaps a jasmine tea ?
What ' s this one ?
That ' s Oolong tea -- it ' s a Cantonese tea .
Ok , I ' ll try that .
Could you be a little more specific , sir ?
Well , to be more specific , the free stuff , like soap , lotion , and shampoo .
I understand . Now , you're saying that you've already used up all your amenities ?
Oh , no ! I've got all I need for my stay here .
So , what's the problem ?
I need souvenirs !
You want some souvenirs !
Yes , yes . Souvenirs .
But , sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items .
That's not the same thing . If you buy hotel souvenirs , they have no sentimental value .
I understand , sir . I'll call housekeeping . You'll have your souvenirs shortly .
Yes , I'd like to look at some suits .
Oh , this way please . What size do you wear ?
Size 41 . I want something in dark flannel .
How about this one ?
It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I'd like it better . This seems too light for winter . Do you think you could get me one ?
All right . I'll show you something darker . Do you like this one ?
It looks good . But can I try it on ?
Of course . Let me help you .
Thanks . It's comfortable . Well , how much is it , please ?
$ 280 .
Ok . I'll take it . Here's the money .
Besides Chinese , I can speak English and French .
You mean you can read and write both of them ?
No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French .
Can you read and write English well ?
I can speak the language better than read and write .
Do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of English-speaking countries ?
I think so . I used to be an interpreter .
Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work ?
The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm .
Where are you going to buy one ?
I'm really not sure .
You like my living room set , don't you ?
Where did you buy it ?
I found mine at IKEA .
Are they expensive ?
Everything I got from IKEA cost me a couple thousand .
Is the furniture crafted well ?
The furniture isn't built cheap .
I'll pay the money , as long as I'm getting what I pay for .
You will feel comfortable paying the money .
May I have your flight number , please ?
World Airlines , Flight 201 .
And your name , please ?
John Anderson .
Yes , sir . You're booked on Flight 201 , leaving in one hour .
Thank you .
I ' m looking for a sweater .
What size are you looking for ?
Well , I ' m looking for size 10 but you don ' t have it .
How about this one ? I think it looks terrific on you .
Yes , I like the color . Can I try it on ?
Sure . The fitting room is on your right .
It fits well . I like it a lot . What do you think ?
You look pretty in red .
Oh , it ' s my favorite . How much is it ?
$ 29 . 99 .
Okay . I ' ll take it . Thank you very much for your help .
You ' re welcome .
Good Morning , I have a bad cough , and I want to see an internist .
Do you have a registration card ?
No , I don ' t . I ' m a tourist .
Then you need to register as a new patient . Can I have a look at you ID card ? I need your name , age , occupation , address and contacting number .
Here you are .
Thanks . Which kind of medicine do you prefer , western medicine or traditional Chinese medicine ?
I ' d like to try traditional Chinese medicine . I heard it really works quite well if you know what you're doing .
All right . Yes , he does . The registration fee is 7 yuan , please .
Speaking .
Excuse my troubling you . You purchased our products last year and now I am following up to find out about their workings . Are they still in good condition now ?
Yeah , exactly ! I bought them last year . En ... at present , they are still in good state .
That's it ! All of them have first-class quality and performance . Besides , we adopt advanced technology . Now we have developed new products . They are much better than what you have bought .
Your company is developing so fast . Maybe later on I will plan to buy more .
That's great ! Thanks for your support . If any , please remember to call us . I am afraid I have to say goodbye now ! Bye , Mr . James !
Bye !
Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant .
Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ?
Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ?
There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table .
The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ?
You know , that is one of my favorites !
OK , I'll take one order of that .
You could choose another appetizer for half price to share .
Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings .
Yes , I do . How can I help you ?
Well , I've just arrived in my room , but there are no instructions in English about the facilities available ! Could you help me for a moment ?
Of course not . What exactly would you like to know ?
First , what is the number for room service ?
It's 1200 . Room service is available 24 hours a day .
Very good . Now , could you help me to adjust the air conditioning , please ? It's too hot in my room .
Yes , the control unit is on the wall next to the bathroom . Is 24 ° C all right ?
Yes , that's perfect . Another thing , if need more items for the mini-bar , which Number should I call ?
You should call the Housekeeping Department on 2300 . They will replace any stock for you immediately .
I see . So , is it possible to make international phone calls from my room ?
That's no problem . Just dial 9 to get an outside line , and then dial the number as usual .
Well , thanks a lot for your help .
No problem , sir . If there's anything else you need , you can find me at the desk by the elevator , or you can call housekeeping if I'm not there .
OK , goodbye .
Goodbye , sir .
I ' m trying to put the vase on the shelf .
Let regive you a hand .
No , thank you . I can manage it , I think .
Very interesting . Thank you for bringing it to us .
Are you interested in making this investment ?
We haven't decided yet , we will let you know if we do .
Yes . Is there anything you can give me to get rid of it , Doctor ?
I ' m going to prescribe some antibiotics , and some cream to ease the itching and burning .
OK . Thank you . Where should I buy them ?
The pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic .
Great . What floor is the pharmacy on ?
The fourth . I ' ll send the prescription down there , so you can just pick it up on your way out .
Thank you .
You are late . The last piece has sold out .
Really ? Is there ' Wall Street Journal ' , please ?
There are several , take a piece . The crash appears in the headline . It is famous for offering catastrophe stories .
I have a long flight for ten hours . I need to choose a magazine .
There are various magazines in the rack .
Give me the latest issue of ' National Geographic ' .
That's the top magazine in America and is popular with young people . OK . It is totally 30 dollars .
Here you are .
Have a nice trip .
I went first last time .
No , Mary went first last time .
Oh , Okay .
I ' Ve been having trouble breathing lately .
Have you had any type of cold lately ?
No , I haven ' t had a cold . I just have a heavy feeling in my chest when I try to breathe .
Do you have any allergies that you know of ?
No , I don ' t have any allergies that I know of .
Does this happen all the time or mostly when you are active ?
It happens a lot when I work out .
I am going to send you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma .
Thank you for your help , doctor .
What ?
Don't take that tone with me ! I saw you hit your brother .
No ! He hit me first .
I don't care . You know better than to hit him . Go sit on your bed for 10 minutes .
Sorry , I won't . I'll be working against the clock to finish my presentation .
I have a flat tyre .
All right . What's your membership card , please ?
489 3362 1978 .
And your name ?
Eve .
What's the expiration date on your card ?
It's July 16,2009 .
Where is your car now ?
It's on the west street , near Royal Hotel .
And which direction were you going ?
I was going west .
What is the make and model of your car ?
BMW 530 .
What color is it ?
It's red .
What's your licence plate number ?
SAY 201 .
All right , Madam . I'll have a tow truck there within 30 minutes .
How long will the system be down for ?
We'll be taking everything offline in about two hours ' time . It'll be down for a minimum of twelve hours . If everything goes according to plan , it should be up again by 6 pm on Saturday .
That's fine . We've allowed forty-eight hours to be on the safe side .
Sure , I ' d be glad to . What time frame did he have in mind ?
He ' d like to do it as soon as possible , sir . How about tomorrow at 2:45 ?
Mm , yeah , that ' ll be great . Tell him I ' ll see him then .
Well , depends . You see , there are eight famous Chinese food cuisines , for instance , sichuan cuisine and HUNAN cuisine .
There're all spicy or hot of heard .
That ' s right . If you have hot dishes , you can try some .
It might be too hot for me .
And there are Cantonese cuisine and Kiangsu cuisine .. Most people like them .
What about any special Beijing dishes ?
There ' re Beijing roast duck .
OH , yes . I heard of a lot of about it . I like very much to try it . Where can I find it ?
You can find it in most restaurant . The best place certainly is Quanjude restaurant .
Is it near here ?
Not too near but not too far either . A taxi will take you there in fifteen minutes . the traffic is not too bad , I mean .
Well , thank you for your information . What ' s the name of that restaurant again ?
Let me write it down on a piece of paper for you . You can show to the taxi driver .
That ' s very kind of you . Thanks a lot .
I'm afraid he is not in at the moment .
May I ask what time he will come back ?
I think he will come back at 3 p . m . Do you want to call later ? Or would you like to leave a message for him ?
I'd like to leave a message . Please ask him to call me back as soon as he returns . I'm A and he has my number .
OK . I will do that .
Thank you very much . Bye .
You're welcome . Bye .
I'll try Chinese wine .
What about this dry red ? It's good indeed , it never goes to the head .
OK . Give me one , please .
Here it is .
Thank you .
I'm always at your service .
Wait a moment , mom .
I'm mad ! I said now ! Turn off the TV , and do it now .
Mom , just ten more minutes . The show is going to be over soon .
Peter , if you don't do it soon , I will throw your toys in the trash can .
Fine , just fine . How about you ?
Not too bad .
Yes , I went to Cambridge . After graduation , I started right away into the advertising industry . Later , I made a bit of a switch to focus on marketing research .
So , what experience do you have ?
I have ten years marketing experience . This includes both entry level and management positions . In my last position , I worked my way up to being director of the marking department .
I can see that from your resume . Your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company , is that right ? Later , why did you decide to leave your former post ?
I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new .
I see . Do you want to work full-time or part-time ?
I would rather work full-time .
I'll make note of that . Now , what are your salary expectations ?
I am willing to negotiate , but I expect at least $ 40,000 a year .
One Big Mac and French Fries .
Is there anything else ?
Give me one coke , please .
Is this to go or to eat here ?
To go , please .
That comes to four dollars and ten cents .
And can I have some ketchup , please ?
It's on the service counter over there . Please go to help yourself .
Yes , I did . But when I got home , my son put it on and we found the hole .
Really ? Let me have a look at it . Mm . OK . Let me change it for another one .
Thank you very much .
I need to open a second account .
What kind of account would you like to open ?
I need another savings account .
Do you have another account with us ?
I sure do .
Would you like to transfer money from that account into your new one ?
That ' s fine .
How much would you like to transfer ?
Transfer $ 100 .
Give me a moment while I complete your transaction .
That ' s fine . Thank you .
I would like to fight my ticket .
Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today ?
Yes , the officer is here today .
What's your case ?
I was pulled over for running a red light , but I never did .
Do you believe that the officer lied ?
There was a camera on the signal . So , he was obviously lying .
Your license plate was caught on camera ?
A picture of my license plate was never taken .
Since there is no picture of your license plate on record , I'm going to let you go .
Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me .
What's going on ?
Look . Two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . That's why that car stops .
More and more people easily get irritated while driving .
Yes . This is what is called road rage .
Is that right ? This is a brand new outfit .
What store did you get it from ?
I went to Macy's and picked it out .
I love your outfit right now .
Well , I think you look nice today too .
Thanks . I found these new shoes earlier at the store .
I think that those are some really nice shoes . What kind are they ?
These are Chucks .
Your shoes look really nice . How much did you get them for ?
They only cost me about forty dollars .
I'm going to go get a pair for myself .
My hands are full . Can ' t you see that ?
Please , George .
All right . Just wait a minute , OK ?
Please Show your ticket and passport .
Here you are .
Which flight do you want to change ?
The next one to my destination . I have to be there as soon as possible .
Yes , I ' m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ?
Did you have the room checked before we move in ?
Which room are you in ?
1808 . The toilet doesn ' t work properly ; the water doesn ' t run in the shower .
I ' m awfully sorry to hear that . I ' ll turn to it right away .
sure . i suppose you dance much .
oh . no as a matter of fact , i haven't danced for a long time .
but i can see you dance wonderfully well .
thanks for flattering me .  i think you dance much right ?
no , just occasionally
oh , i like this music very much , let's tango .
i'm afraid i can't dance well .
No , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh .
Oh , sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual . I will look into the matter .
This is very annoying .
I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course .
No , I don't risk it .
How about a delicious dessert then , with our compliment ?
I'm not keen on dessert as a habit . They are fattening .
I see , sir . I'm sure everything will be right next time you come .
Calm down , sir . What's your name and where are you now ?
My name is Jerry and we are on the intersection of West Road and East Road .
Sir , leave the house if the fire draws any closer to your house . Our men will be over in 5 minutes .
I couldn't sleep well recently .
You'd get plenty of sleep for you work so hard .
I always drink too much wine in the evening .
You shan't drink more wine in the evening .
Yes , you are right .
And you'd take some exercise every day .
Many thanks for your advice .
What happened to you ? You look like you got hit by a tornado !
I just got back from fighting the crowds .
You mean at the mall ? Was there a sale ?
Yeah . For five minutes , everything was half off . It was total chaos ...
Cool !
Grabbing , pushing and shoving ...
OK , what does that entail ?
It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances .
Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ?
Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate .
I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ?
Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu .
Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today .
Thanks , Denise . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean , there were a lot of qualified people out there .
Sure . But the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it !
Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon , too . You ' Ve been doing some great work !
Oh , I remember , there is a job fair in the personnel market .
I have never been to the personnel market .
Really ? I have been there several times .
Are there many employers ?
Yes . The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers .
So there will be many large companies in the personnel market , right ?
Yes , there are many famous corporations .
When will there be a job fair ?
Every Saturday and Sunday
Do I need to pay to go into the personnel market ?
No , it's free .
How about going there to have a look now ?
OK , let's go .
As you know , we are in a very special time . This is a very hard time for many countries ' economics , both developed and developing . I think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies .
What is the direct impact of the terrorist attack upon your country's economy ?
Once the US economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack , the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world .
What challenges is your country's economy facing at the moment ?
We do face a lot of challenges because there is still much uncertainty about the world economy . It's very important for us to strike a proper balance between investment in fixed assets and household consumption .
Thanks , Mr . Liang .
Among all the assistants , I think you're on top of it . Based on the annual evaluation , the board of directors decided to give you a bonus .
Really ? I am too happy .
I've been reviewing your work over the past few months . Thanks to your excellent work , we benefit much from your project . And you should get the perfect attendance award too .
Thanks for your trust . Owing to my colleagues ' help , I've successfully completed my task .
You are very modest and diligent . The distribution of bonus derived from the performance evaluation . You deserve it .
Thank you very much . I will redouble my efforts in the future .
Yes . How do I get an outside line , please ?
Just dial 0 , wait for the dial tone , and then dial the phone number you want to call . Or we can place a call for you , if you want .
No , thanks a lot . I'll try it myself .
I like Chinese food , too . I like dumplings best .
At school , we sometimes have Chinese food for lunch .
That's good . We eat Chinese food only at the Chinese restaurant .
My mother can make some Chinese food .
Really ? That's wonderful !
There is a Matisse exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art . Larry and I will go .
Did you buy tickets already ?
No . Do we need tickets ?
Well , probably . Probably you will have to wait in line if you don't have tickets .
Outside or inside ?
Outside , on the sidewalk .
Hmm . It's very cold today . But I brought my jacket . Maybe it will be alright to wait .
The MYOMA is very popular . There will be a lot of people .
MYOMA ? What's that ?
Oh , sorry . It stands for the Museum of Modern Art . It's an acronym . M O M A MYOMA .
I see . Do you have any suggestions for other things we should do ?
I suggest you go to the Jewish Museum . It ' s not far from the Guggenheim , near Central Park . It is really very interesting . Also , there is a great museum of medieval European art further up north . It ' s called the Cloisters .
How can we get up there ?
You can take a bus .
But Larry says the neighborhoods in the north are dangerous .
It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .
Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .
Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area .
I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
How much do you think the rent will be ?
I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
With pleasure .
Thanks you . Shall we stand a bit further ? I would like to take the tower in .
No problem .
That's OK . If you want the photo I will mail it to you .
No need , sir .
Yes , we shall . What size do you like ?
Well , the 4 x 6 is fine .
Which do you prefer , color or black and white ?
The last one is black and white , all the rest should need color .
OK .
I hope they will come out well . When should I pick them up ?
They will be ready at noon tomorrow . Each negative develops one print , right ?
Yes , it is . And develop them as glossy as possible .
No problem . Do you need another film ?
Yes , a roll of Kodak film please .
It is totally $ 20 including the deposit for films .
Yes , I need to talk to him .
I'll put the call through then .
Thank you .
exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment .
on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health .
I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse
what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?
it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .
I see , so it's similar to global warming ?
they're related to one another , yes .
I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .
people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .
people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .
I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place .
We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments .
I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house .
We need to find a good realtor .
Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .
What do you mean ?
Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .
But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .
Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .
I still think we should have a realtor . We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has
Of course we need a home inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .
So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?
It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .
And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?
Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .
Why ?
Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .
Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .
It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .
I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .
Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store .
I'm doing the business online .
Can you tell me the concept of e-commerce ? Now , many people mentioned the word , ' e-commerce ' , in front of me .
E-commerce , or Electronic Commerce is the practice of purchasing and selling products or services over the Internet .
What kinds of channels can you use in e-commerce ?
We can complete a trade by email , electronic data interchange and smart cards , and so on .
What are the benefits of e-commerce ?
Firstly , it can overcome the geographic limitation . And secondly , e-commerce can lower the internal costs . And thirdly , people like us , can also open stores on Internet .
How things have changed now !
I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .
I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !
I told you we should have stayed in town today . The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow . Why did you want to come up here ?
I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .
Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?
I don't know .
I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .
What do you mean ?
We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time . We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .
I have plenty of gas .
Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working . We can't just let the car run and run . If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .
So what can we do ?
Turn the lights off . Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . That will conserve the heat as long as possible .
Alright . That's a good idea .
I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .
Days ?
Yes , it happens . That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .
Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .
Probably we'll survive . But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .
I have earned 10,000 a year including bonuses .
How much do you want us to pay you ?
I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 150,000 a year . To be honest , I left the company to get more income .
University Street .
Do you know of any banks near here ?
You'll see one at the corner on your right .
I know , but these are the figures that we came up with .
No !
Come on ! I'll pay you back on Tuesday .
Last time I lent you money , you never paid me back .
I promise if you lend me five dollars today , I will repay you in full next week .
Ok , but I'm taking your skateboard as collateral .
Fine ! I can't believe you don't trust me .
It's nothing personal , just business .
Oh , that's right . And the general manager asked me to report the company's sales for last year at the meeting .
By the way , the meeting will be held in your office .
OK , thank you very much .
Not at all . That's what I should do .
I need to buy a new refrigerator today .
Were you looking at a particular refrigerator ?
I like that Kenmore refrigerator .
This particular refrigerator is a very good choice .
Tell me about it .
Not only is it affordable , but it comes with all the appliances .
What are the appliances .
It has an ice maker , water dispenser , and plenty of room on the inside .
I'd like to see it for myself .
Go right ahead .
I like what I see .
Every five minutes .
Oh , here comes a bus !
It comes on the dot .
Any other discomfort ?
Yes . Sometimes I can notice a constriction in the chest and shortness of breath after a fit of sneezing . And I often suffer from a running nose with a profuse watery discharge .
Does it occur seasonally or all year round ?
It has been seasonal during these past three years .
Are you sensitive to other things ?
Yes , things like seafood and penicillin-type drugs .
OK . Let me examine your nose . According to your case history and the examination , I believe that it's allergic rhinitis .
What useful treatment can you offer ?
I'll give you a series of specific skin tests . Then we'll know exactly what substances you're allergic to . Then I'll give you some causes of desensitization therapy .
I'm afraid we'll be late for the party .
Have you got the time , Tom ?
Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch !
But you bought it only last month .
Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired .
How long will it take us to get there ?
I think about ten minutes by bus .
It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain .
Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus .
I'm sorry ; he's out at the moment .
When do you expect him back ?
I think he'll be back in about an hour at least .
Well , may I leave a message ?
Yes , of course .
Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ?
Ok . Does he know your number ?
I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 .
13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on .
It ' s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves
Dick ? How come ? He used to be as meek as a lamb .
Yes , he used to be . But now he ' s drifting off track .
He must have been in bad company , or he wouldn ' t be off the beans .
He's a bright boy , isn't he ?
But he always wimps out of difficulty .
Don't worry , he'll make good progress step by step .
We can print as many as you like . Just tell me how many .
Two thousand should get me through the year .
Here's a form to get you started .
My old card is perfect , so all I want you to do is copy it exactly .
I think you'll be very pleased with how well we duplicate your old card .
... Here you go
Thanks . Come back here next Wednesday to pick up your order , please .
I'm sorry , but can you give me a three-day turnaround ?
If you don't mind paying a little extra , it's absolutely no problem .
Pretty good . The HR manager asked me the usual questions . Then he wondered why I had decided to leave my previous job .
What did you say ?
I told him that I hadn ' t got a raise for three years . I also told him that one of my best co-workers quitted her job because she had not been promoted for eight years .
Did he want to know the reasons ?
Yes . I told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession . But I thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only .
That ' s sex discrimination . When will you get the reply ?
In a couple of days , I was told .
Wish you good luck !
Thank you .
Yes , a very long time .
What brings you here ?
I'm here on vacation .
Cancelled ? That's just can't happen !
Sorry to say , but nothing can be done . The equipment broke down and can't be fixed till Friday .
Oh , I hope it be fixed on Friday .
Oh , hello , Tom ! Beautiful day , isn ' t it ?
Yes , it is !
OK . How much is the fare ?
The total is 45 yuan .
45 yuan ? It is too much , Are you sure ?
It is 45 yuan on the meter .
Is there something wrong with your meter ?
No . I am sure about that .
OK . Could you give me a receipt ?
Yes . This is your receipt .
Hi Angie , it ' s Tom Reynolds here . Can you tell me if my tuition fees for this semester have been approved ?
Yes , Mr . Reynolds . They were approved yesterday . You can pick up the check today .
Oh wow ! Thanks a million , Angie !
Good morning . There is no reason to miss so beautiful a morning . Is that a new bird ?
Oh , yes , my daughter bought it yesterday . We call her Lulu .
It looks so cute . Is it a parrot ?
Yes . Just look at her colorful feathers . What else can it be ?
I see . It's interesting that there is also a parrot in my English book . His mane is Polly .
Really ? A foreign parrot !
He can speak English , too .
Maybe you can teach Lulu some English words .
Lulu . Lulu . Say hello . hello . Oh , she is so smart . Good bird .
Hi Marry , this is Tom .
How can I help you ?
I need to see if we can get together today .
Yes , I spent so much time sightseeing here . It is already so late now . I am afraid I can't catch the last bus back to downtown .
Don't worry . I will try to get a taxi for you . You can take it to the bus station .
I am very grateful to your help .
Don't mention it . It is my duty .
Thanks again .
Yes , I'm glad we've had very pleasant cooperation in the previous years . And your achievement for promoting our clothes was great in the three years .
So , I wish to apply for the sole agency of your product in our local market . If you give us the agency , that will be more substantial for our cooperation .
To be frank , you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country . I'd like to know some ideas of terms on which you would be willing to operate as our agent .
As we are a well-established company , we are very familiar with the customers ' needs . Besides , we can make full use of our good connections with the wholesalers and retailers here and develop a good market for your products if appointed as your agent .
Sounds reasonable . I will tell my boss about you agent application . Another question , what do you think is the minimum annual sales you can guarantee ?
To be on the safe side , and for garment of all materials , sizes , and styles , I think the amount will be 50,000 pieces a year .
Well . As our sole agency , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own .
No , certainly not .
He stepped out of the office for a little while .
When is a good time to catch him ?
In about twenty minutes .
well , I'm looking for some summer clothes .
Oh , it is the right time for you purchasing in our clothes shop . We are now having a low price on all our summer apparel .
Really ? What's that ?
Everything for summer is 20 % off .
I like this T-shirt . Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with it ?
Sure . We have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the T-shirt . Look at this section .
This one is good .
You have good taste . It is very much in style this year .
I'll take this one . How much are they ?
160 yuan .
Here you are .
Oh , sorry . I didn ' t know .
What ? You haven ' t taken the bus before ?
No , I ' m afraid not .
Well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . Besides , you should let old people on first .
Sorry .
It ' s all right . Where are you going ?
I wanted to see the White House .
Oh , well you don ' t want this bus , anyway . It goes to Georgetown .
Oh , no .
It ' s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A .
Oh , well thank you very much .
You ' re welcome .
Sure .
How long does it take ?
6 hours . If you are in a hurry we can develop it in 3 hours .
There is no need . I will come back tomorrow .
That's what I am going to do .
If you have any problem , please come to me .
I surely will . How much is this wood carving ?
You are an expert on it . That wood carving is very rare . But I'm so sorry . that is not for sell .
That's OK . Is anything else recommended ?
Do you have any special request ?
I'd like to see some traditional arts .
So that means you are shopping for presents ?
Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends .
Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle .
Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut .
I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best .
You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale .
As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country .
Wow , you are the expert on it .
Great . Are you a qualified teacher ?
Yes .
What kind of teaching certificate do you have ?
I have a TEFL certificate .
How many years of experience do you have ?
I have three years of teaching ESL and four years of teaching per-school children .
When did you get your TEFL certificate ?
I got my TEFL certificate three years ago .
Why do you want to teach at our school ?
Well , I ' Ve heard many good things about it . I also like teaching young children .
That ' s great . Can you speak Chinese ?
Yes , just a little .
Can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10:00 ?
I sure can .
Great . See you then .
Uh ... Andrew . Hello . I can't quite remember you .
It's me . The D-man ! I sat behind you in English . Are you and Taylor still dating ?
Um ... we never were . We're just friends .
Well , if you're not seeing anyone , maybe we could ...
... I am seeing someone . This is Yi-jun , my ...
I'm so happy you remember , please come in and enjoy the party . Everyone's here , I'm sure you have a good time .
Brian , may I have a pleasure to have a dance with you ?
Ok .
This is really wonderful party .
Yes , you are always popular with everyone . and you look very pretty today .
Thanks , that's very kind of you to say . I hope my necklace goes with my dress , and they both make me look good I feel .
You look great , you are absolutely glowing .
Thanks , this is a fine party . We should have a drink together to celebrate your birthday
We have to find a shelter .
All right .
Let's go under the tree .
No , we can't . It's thundering .
Then let's go to that store .
Yes , the bookshop is just around the corner . Turn left and you ' ll see the bookshop .
Thank you very much . By the way , is the hospital beside the bookshop .
Right , if you see the bookshop , you can see the hospital .
Thank you for your help .
Not at all .
Of course .
Well , I think this one is a little too small . Would you please bring me a bigger one ?
I am sorry the larger ones are out of stock now . But you might be lucky at our Branch .
It suits my taste . You are really a good cook .
Would you like to try my special recipe ?
Wow , let me try . It tastes nice . How did you make it ?
It ' s as easy as pie . I always follow recipes .
My husband and I have thought about it , but we've decided not to have any . They're just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of Worl
Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ?
For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share .
Don't you think you would miss having other people around ?
No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy
If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ?
That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like
Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?
I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children !
How long will you stay there ?
About one week .
Where will you live during the vacation .
In the hotel .
Have you made a reservation ?
Yes , we have .
That's OK .
I've got a terrible pain in my stomach , Doctor .
I see . When did it start ?
It started yesterday . I didn't eat any supper .
Have you got a temperature ?
I think so . I feel very hot .
Let's see . Yes . You ' Ve got quite a high temperature .
I've got an awful headache , too , and my throat hurts .
Hm ... I think you ' Ve got the flu .
Is it serious ?
No , not at all , but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine .
How often must I take it ?
Three times a day after meals .
Thank you , Doctor . Goodbye .
You ' re welcome . Can I ask you what brings you to China ?
I ' m actually travelling around Asia .
Oh , very nice . How long will you be in Beijing ?
Probably another week .
Oh , I see . Well , I ' ll give you my phone number and if you need a guide , please call me .
Thank you very much . That ' s very kind .
Hello , doctor .
What's the matter ?
I've got a backache .
Do you often suffer from backache ?
No , I don't . I've never had a bad one before .
When did it start ?
About four days ago .
Well , go home and rest in bed for two days , then you'll feel better .
Can you give me some medicine ? It's very painful .
Yes , I'll give you some pills . Take one a time and three times a day , and come back in three days . If you don't feel ...
This is Mr . White speaking .
Hi . I understand that you have a house for sale , haven ' t you ?
Yes .
I ' d like to know more about it .
Can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o ' clock ?
OK . I will be there .
Thank you for calling . Goodbye .
Bye .
Hello , this is John . I want to speak to Linda .
This is her .
Hi , Linda , I'm just calling to invite you to a dinner party tomorrow evening .
Really ? What time and where ?
7:30 PM at London-Chinese restaurant . I \ ' ll be at your place at seven to pick you up if you need a ride .
Yes , please , I'll need a ride . I'll be waiting for you then .
See you tomorrow at seven . Make sure your dress a little formally . I heard the restaurant is kind of upscale .
Thank you , see you then .
See you .
I'm from Lexington Software and I'm here to collect an export L / C .
I have it right here .
Great . Can I take it with me now ? Or do you need me to fill in some forms or something ?
No , you can take it away now . I just need you to sign here .
Here you are .
Just one thing before you go , could you please prepare your documents in accordance with the L / C within the validity period ?
No problem , I'll get on that right away . Thanks , bye .
Yes , we do . We like it very much .
I've come to make sure that your stay in Beijing is a pleasant one .
Thank you so much .
I just got it at the special health store . It's for my flabby arms .
Let me know how it works .
I have to say , I have had enough of this roller coaster .
I know what you mean . I'm like a yo-yo .
Last week I was down to 60 kilos . This week I had one donut more . Now I'm up to 62 kilos .
No , I ' m afraid we don ' t .
I ' m sorry the restaurant is full now . You have to wait for about half an hour . Would you like to have a drink at the lounge until there ' s a table available .
No , thanks , I ' ll come back later . May I reserve a table for two ?
Yes , of course . May I have your name , sir ?
Bruce By the way , can we have a table by the window ?
we ' ll try to arrange it , but I can ' t guarantee sir .
That ' s fine .
your table's ready , sir ? Please step this way .
You should do one of the two things - either to lodge a claim with the shipowner or with the insurance company .
Shall we leave it to the brokers ?
Yes . They usually do it .
Do they charge for that ?
Of course . In Europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service .
Is it the same in America ?
They do the work without charge to the importer .
It's part of their service , isn't it ?
Exactly .
Is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ?
No , you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment .
I see . By the way , how do we prove the ownership of our goods ?
You must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice .
I see . Thank you .
You are welcome .
I've been told that Chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship . We'd like to take some home . What would you recommend ?
There are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop . For example , there is tricolored pottery originating in the Tang Dynasty , embroidery , batik , jade carving , just to name a few . Do you have anything in mind ?
No , not really . But I think it should be something distinctively Chinese . And easy to carry .
I would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik . They are very easy to carry .
So , we'd like to see some embroidery .
Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm .
How long does it take to get there ?
About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ' d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive .
Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time !
Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers .
Great ! I ' ll take it .
Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train !
I understand . Thank you very much !
Have a great trip .
Right away , sir .
Is this amount correct ?
Yes , sir , it is .
Thank you , the service was good
Please come again .
Not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements .
Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air .
I know , I know . But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world !
Really ? What's the series about ?
Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it .
It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth .
I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results .
Really ? that's interesting !
Yeah . Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good .
OK , I'll give it a go .
Yes . I ' d like to make an appointment with Dr . Galas . Could you arrange it for me ?
Sure . Let me check his schedule . How about tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 ?
I ' m not available tomorrow afternoon . How about tomorrow morning ?
I ' m sorry . Dr . Galas is fully engaged tomorrow morning . How about the day after tomorrow at 9:30 in the morning ?
That ' s fine . Thanks .
You ' re welcome . Could I have your name and phone number , please ?
Certainly . My name is Janet Smith , and my phone number is 610-555-1234 .
Very good , Ms . Smith . I have scheduled an appointment for you on Wednesday at 9:30 am .
Thank you very much .
You ' re welcome .
Hi , Bill . I ' d like to take the apartment I looked at yesterday .
All right .
So , what do we do now ?
This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords .
Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ' ll deposit one month ' s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ' s rent in advance . I understand that I ' ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs .
Yes . If you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out .
Can I pay you by check ?
Sure . A check will be fine .
Is there a laundry room in the basement ?
Yes .
Can I sign the lease right now ?
This is the East market to Central park bus . Where do you want to go ?
To the ministry government hall .
Take the same number bus going other direction . There ' s stop right cross the street .
Thank you .
Sure . Should I wash or dry ?
I wash and you'll dry .
OK . Let's do it .
It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
Yes , I need to refill it today .
Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice .
I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not .
Well , it looks like you have . You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out . Can you just refill it once more ?
I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription . And this prescription has run out .
But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription .
Miss , I understand your problem . But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it . We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never .
But I have a prescription . I just need more of it .
A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law . You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor . It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens . But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry .
This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it .
Maybe that's true . I don't know . But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too .
I am a graduate of a technical university and have been employed as a technician with Company or approximately 10 years .
Please explain why you are interested in leaving your current position and please elaborate on your technical skills .
I am looking for a growth opportunity , which I feel is not available at my current employer . In terms of skills , I am Microsoft certified in Windows XP and several other operating system
Where do you see yourself five years from now ?
I see myself in a management position .
Do I have to get up now ?
You'd better get up , or you'll be late .
What're you talking about ? My alarm even hasn't gone off yet .
Yes , it did . It went off thirty minutes ago . You slept right through it . You're like a dead person while you sleep .
I must have slept right through it .
Rise and shine ! Sleepyhead !
Just let me sleep five more minutes .
The early bird gets the worm .
I know , I know . But I don't want any worms .
Ha ! Ha ! If you don't make an effort now , later on it'll be a lot tougher for you .
Yes , several times .
How do you like them ?
Not bad .
I always have the temptation to eat something there .
Then , why didn't you do that ?
I don't know how much we can trust them . Do you have any ideas ?
Some of them , I think , are not good .
It doesn't taste good ?
No , I mean some of them are not clean enough .
That's my greatest concern . But how can you tell which one is clean ?
I judge by appearances .
I got it . I think it's worth trying .
It certainly is .
I'd like to try some kebab , roasted squid , and many different appealing things .
Don't try everything at one time , please .
I see . Thank you .
Oh , honey , I'm so sorry , we don't have enough space for you to have your own room .
Dad , but I don't want to share a room with Peter . He snores every night .
Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ?
Alright . Maybe it's the only way to do it .
Yeah how ' d you know ?
You can always spot the newbies . I can give you a few pointers if you want . Were you trying to use this machine here ?
Yeah ! I just started my training today and I ' m not really sure where to begin .
It ' s ok , I know how it is . This machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ?
Well , I don ' t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio .
In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ' s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ' s a lot of weight !
It ' s not that much . Just watch ... I ' m ok ...
It's right here . $ 100 .
But I heard other stores were having great mark-downs on this item .
Ours are of really good quality .
I see , please wrap it .
I dare you to say that again .
I come from Greece .
What's the climate like in your country ?
It's very pleasant .
What's the weather like in spring ?
It's often windy in March . It's always warm in April and May , but it rains sometimes .
What's it like in summer ?
It's always hot in June , July and August . The sun shines every day .
Is it cold or warm in autumn ?
It's always warm in September and October . It's often cold in November and it rains sometimes .
Is it very cold in winter ?
It's often cold in December , January and February . It snows sometimes .
Well , right now , we can't afford internet use in the rooms . But you can go to the web bar in our hotel . It's on the 12 floor .
Thank you . I think I will go there .
Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ?
Well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period .
Is there any flexibility on that ?
Unfortunately , not .
OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan .
Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away .
Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it .
Totally agree . What is your solution ?
Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy .
You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
But I don ' t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .
I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
Yes , sir . Where to ?
The city square , please .
Are you in a hurry ?
Yes , I have to be there to meet a friend at 5 thirty pm . So we're sure we can get there on time ?
I'm afraid not , sir . Generally we can , but you know how it is in the rush hour now .
I see . Here's the extra 5 $ for you if you can get me there on time .
All right . I'll do my best .
Oh . we made it . Thank you . How much do I own you ?
The reading on the kilometer is 12 $ .
Here's the money , keep the changes , please .
Do you need a receipt ?
No , thank you .
My present pay is 100,000 Yuan per year .
What are your salary expectations now ?
I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 120,000 Yuan per year .
That's a little more than we had planned .
I think you'll find I'm worth that .
I can only offer you 110,000 Yuan a year . Raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance . Is that satisfactory ?
Yes , it is quite reasonable .
Well , I swim and run every day .
Now , tell me , what do you eat ?
Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .
Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
What do you drink ?
Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
What do you drink ?
So , why don ' t you ?
I have no idea how to use the ATM .
What do you mean ?
This will be my first time using an ATM .
I can help you with that .
Explain to me how to use it .
Just put your card into the machine .
Now what do I do ?
Then you need to type in your PIN .
Now what ?
Just click on one of the choices they give you , and that ' s it .
Sure . Our special wine today is a 1989 Chardonnay .
That sounds pretty good ! How much is it ?
It's $ 4 . 25 cents by the glass . The whole bottle is $ 22 . 5 .
I'd like a bottle please .
I'll need to see your ID please .
Here you go .
Sorry about the inconvenience , you look so young . I had make sure you are over 21 years old .
Do you have any seats for September 16th ?
Let's see ... I'm afraid the 16th is fully booked . But I have seats for the 17th .
The 17th will be fine .
And what date will you be returning ?
Hmm , I guess on the 28th .
Okay , you ' re booked on American Airlines flight 710 , departing JFK at 6:40 p . m . on September 17th . Your return flight is flight 711 , departing London ' s Heathrow Airport at 11:15 a . m . on September 28th .
Sounds good . Thanks a lot .
Certainly , sir . What would you like done to them ?
They're a little bit too long , so I'd like about half an inch taken off them .
All right , sir . They should be ready for you by tomorrow afternoon .
Thank you very much .
It's our pleasure .
If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company .
Beneficial ? I don ' t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating .
But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency .
I doubt that .
An old one .
I know it's old , but what make is it ?
It's a Chevrolet . Why do you ask ? You going into the car business ?
Nothing like that . My cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him , so he's going to sell it - cheap . It's practically new .
well I have been thinking about getting a newer car . I can't afford a brand new one .
Would you like to look at my cousin's car ?
Is it a four-door or a two-door ?
It's a coupe with a vinyl roof .
Does it have automatic transmission ? .
Yes , and it also has power steering , power brakes , and air conditioning .
I guess I might take a look at it .
I'd like to taste Mexican food .
How about the one on Baker Street ?
Oh , I've never seen a better Mexican restaurant .
Good morning , sir !
Good morning , please make yourself comfortable .
Thank you , sir .
Your name and examination number , please .
My name is Du Tao , number 3 .
Pardon ?
Du Tao . D-U for Du and T-A - 0 for Tao .
Yes , Mr . Du , when were you born ?
I was born on January 1st , 1988 . I ' m 20 years old now .
Where do you live ?
I ' m living at Room 222 , Building 18 , N . P . U .
Can you leave me your phone number ?
Gladly , 8962105 2 .
You should go to the dentist .
I hate dentists .
Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .
It always hurts . I hate going .
Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
O . K . , O . K . , I ' ll go .
Good . You feel better after you do .
No , thanks . I've decided to give up smoking .
Really ? Why ?
Well , it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it .
I see . You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ?
That's right . You should give it up , too . It ' s bad for your health .
Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying .
But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started . Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip !
What do you mean ? What are you talking about ?
I mean you couldn't give it up !
What do you mean ?
Masha and Hero are getting divorced .
You are kidding . What happened ?
Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce .
That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ?
Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out .
That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ?
Early in the New Year I guess .
I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand .
That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out .
Sure , for at least three thousand per month .
That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for .
I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent .
That ' s a big order , Jane . I am really swamped .
I know what you ' re saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy .
Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? It won ' t take more than a half hour , will it ?
That's no problem . Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ?
Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off .
That's long leave . How's your project coming along ?
The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on .
Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave .
Thank you , Mr . Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr . Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients .
Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed .
I will . Many thanks , Mr . Black .
We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain . Do you like them ?
Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them .
You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ?
Sounds good . May I have a look ?
Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on .
They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs .
All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality .
Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ?
This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac .
Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones .
OK , I will wrap them for you .
OK , don ' t worry about it . I will .
Take care of yourself .
How long have you been feeling this way ?
It all started the day before yesterday .
You seem to have picked up some kind of infection .
What should I do ?
Take a few days off from work and don't wear yourself out .
Yes , do you have sweaters ?
This way , please . How do you like this one ? It's made of cotton .
You have quite a range , haven't you ? I would like to see some other styles .
Hi , Cindy . It ' s Michael Kurt . Is Mr . Johnson in ?
No , I ' m sorry , Mr . Kurt . He ' s stepped out for a bit . Would you like me to have him call you ?
Yeah , that ' ll be great . I ' m on extension 4283 .
What kind of keys ?
Five keys and a small foot ornament .
What a shame ! I didn't see them .
Well , can you help me look for it ? That's my first time here .
Sure . It's my pleasure . I'd like to help you look for the missing keys .
It's very kind of you .
It's not a big deal . Hey , I found them .
Oh , thank God ! I don't know how to thank you , guys .
You're welcome .
Just a minute , please . It's in my bag . Here it is .
Thank you . Please fill out the Baggage Declaration Form .
All right . Shall I enter all my belongings ?
No , only the articles listed on the Declaration .
Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
I'd rather get one with separated speakers . They give a clear sound .
Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony .
Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration .
I learned from your ad . That you will provide on-the-job training for new employees . This is just what I need , because I'm a recent college graduate . I have the necessary knowledge and skills but I lack experience .
What do you hope to become ?
I want to prove my true value in the electronic industry , and hopefully in the near future I would be promoted to a higher position .
Well , thank you for coming . We ' ll let you know as soon as possible .
Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles .
Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control .
No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go .
I'm on a diet . So I have to avoid food containing too much fat . Do you have vegetarian dishes ?
Yes , We do have some choices for ladies like you . What about some green salad ?
Does it taste good ?
Sure . It's a popular dish among young ladies .
I think I'll try it .
We have three kinds of dressings for salad . Italian , French and Thousand Island . Which one would you like ?
French , please .
OK . Do you want to order something else ?
Milan Style Macaroni . Don't put sugar or salt on it , please .
Yes , this week's issue just came in . Here it is .
How about Music Madness ?
Let me check ... yes , we got the October issue a few days ago . It's on that shelf over there .
Okay , I'll take these two magazines and a copy of Today's Post .
Would you turn off the tap ?
I did it .
Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door ?
OK . I will .
I'll have our housekeeper come right away .
I'm sorry I was too tired to fall asleep .
When you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub .
Right . Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ?
Is that Sue ?
Speaking .
A . This is George .
Hello , George . What ' s up ?
Sure , why not ?
This is a new product of company this year . It's oil-free .
I see . It feels very light on the skin .
It gives your skin a very natural healthy look .
I like the cool smell , too .
No , can I take a message ?
No , I'll call back later .
All right .
Yes , unlikely my flight will be 2 hours due to the fog . Would you please keep my reservation ?
Sure . May I have your name please ?
Lincoln . That's L-I-N-C-O-L-N . Thank you .
OK , Mum , when will you be back ?
I'll be back in ten days .
Take me to the airport , please .
Are you in a hurry ?
I have to be there before 17 o'clock .
We'll make it except a jam . You know it's rush hour .
There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
I'll do my best .
Here's twenty dollars .
Do you have small bills ?
No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ?
Here is your receipt . Thank you .
Yes ?
Can you tell me the way to the Peak Tram , please ?
Certainly . Go along Queen's Road ...
Along Queen's Road ...
Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel .
Right at the Hilton .
Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral .
The Cathedral ?
Yes . Then cross the road at the next traffic lights . The Peak Tram is straight ahead . You can't miss it .
That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ?
Yes . Why ?
Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down .
No , thank you .
Would you like us to deliver the mattress for you , sir ?
That would be great .
When do you want it delivered ?
I need it delivered tomorrow . Will that be possible ?
What time exactly ?
I need it delivered at 12 o'clock .
We can have it to you at that time .
That's not a problem ?
We will deliver your mattress tomorrow at 12 o'clock .
That's great ! Thank you very much .
When did you last time have your eyes checked ?
Two years ago . At that time I had no problems . Now I can ' t even make out something ten meters away .
Come over here . I will test your eyes . First cover your left eye like this , and when I point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can , telling me which way the " E " points .
All right .
Good . Now the other eye .
Well , this one is worse .
Never mind , just read as far as you can .
I can only read the first three lines .
No problem . Wait a moment .
Thanks , Jane .
If you need any help , just let me know .
Yes , could you put me in the no-smoking section ?
Yes . Would you like a window seat ?
If one's available , please . But not over the wing .
Yes , Mr . Ford . The dentist will be ready to see you in a minute . Have a seat .
Thank you .
I'm sorry . These batteries are not on sale .
But that's what the ad said .
I'm sorry . If you look at the ad again , you'll see that the other brand is on sale .
Oh . You're right . I misread the ad .
Yes , many people make that mistake .
Well , you can't blame them . It's a confusing ad .
You're right . Many ads are like that .
Well , as long as I'm here .
Just one second , and I'll give you the batteries that are on sale .
Oh , hi , Mary , come on in . Any problem ?
Oh , no problem .
Great . I forgot to ask you , though . How long did you want the place ?
Six months .
Oh , well , that might be a problem . I usually only sign one year leases .
Well , one year would be fine , too . I ' m not planning on leaving the area anytime soon .
Well , if it ' s not a problem . Then here you go .
Just let me look at it quickly .
Of course .
Looks like a standard lease .
Yeah , and don ' t worry about the security deposit . If everything ' s all right when you move out , you ' ll get it back .
O . K . Great . Just sign and date it here ?
Yes . Thanks . You can move your stuff in tomorrow .
Wonderful .
Yes , we will depart in 10 minutes .
Is that a guided tour ?
Yes , it is .
That's fine . Let's get on the bus .
Certainly , sir . How much do you draw ?
RIB 8,000 , please . Would you please tell me my balance ?
Yes , sir . Your balance is RIB 34,000 .
I'm an apprentice with a local engineering firm . My training lasts for two years . Two days a week I study Engineering at a local college . If I pass all my exams , I hope the company will take me on as an engineer .
Sure . Why don ' t you try it on ? The fitting room is over there .
It ' s just the right size-a perfect fit ! Have you seen anything you like ?
I ' m thinking about buying this sweater . I know it ' s June now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
It looks too big for you , but I like the color and the material is good quality . Is it on sale ?
Yes , it ' s half price . It ' s supposed to be too large--that ' s the fashion .
I might get one too , but in a different color . I prefer light blue to white .
There . It looks great , don ' t you think ? I ' m going to get these jeans as well . I need a new pair . I ' m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter .
I ' m getting this beret ? Doesn ' t it look cool ? I ' d like to get some jeans too , but I don ' t have enough cash on me .
Don ' t worry . I ' Ve got my credit card . You can pay me back later .
Thanks ! Now I don ' t need to come back to the shop a second time .
Yes . I promise it will not happen again .
We look forward to your settlement at an early date .
We will inform you as soon as possible .
Here you are . Do you need glue ?
That is very kind of you . I ' m just running out of glue .
You ' re welcome .
Are you having a meeting ?
Yes , and I don't want to be interrupted .
I understand .
Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station .
Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right .
Right ? OK , got it .
Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ?
Next left then right ? OK .
Do you have a reservation ?
Yes , I called you last week from New York . My name is George Lee .
Wait a second , PLS . Yes , Mr . Lee , we have a room reserved for you . How long do you plan to stay ?
Probably two days . My wife will join me tomorrow . Then we will decide when to leave for Seattle .
Would you sign the register , PLS ?
By the way , does my room have a private bath ?
Certainly , every room in this hotel has a private bath .
Does my room have twin beds or a double ? I prefer a room with twin beds .
Your room has twin beds , Mr . Lee . It also has a view . I am sure you will like it . This is your key . It's on the eighth floor room 801 . The elevator's over there .
Thank you . One more thing , where is your restaurant ?
The restaurant is on the second floor . We also have a cafeteria on the top floor . If you would like something to drink , you can either call room service or come down here . The bar is right behind the lobby .
Thank you , you are very kind !
You are welcome !
Use them from the outside in .
I see . A set for appetizers and another for the main course .
Right . We do the same thing at home . Don't you remember ?
Oh yeah . The big napkin goes on my lap .
Let's look at our menus .
Cindy , help me order because I'm still not very familiar with American cooking .
Well , we order appetizers first and then entrees .
I am wondering if you do facial care ?
Yes , we do .
How much would it be ?
From 200 to 800 .
I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ?
No problem .
What did you find ?
I found some jeans , and a new blouse .
Go and try it on .
What do you think ?
I love that shirt on you .
What about the jeans ?
They don't really fit you right .
I don't think so either .
That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though .
Well , I'll just buy the shirt .
That would be a good idea .
Can I have Mr . J . Smith paged ? He said he'd be in the main dining room . I'm Mr . J . B . White .
Who would you like to have paged again , sir ?
Mr . J . Smith .
Where would you like him to come ?
To the front desk .
Just a moment , please .
I haven't heard anything .
My boss offered me a promotion , and I took it .
Are you serious ?
Yes , I am really excited .
That's great . Congratulations .
I appreciate that .
You have no idea how happy I am for you .
For real ?
I believe you were the best choice for that promotion . I really do .
Wait a moment . Here you are .
By the way , we would like to order some dishes for my friend .
Sure .
This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two .
Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ?
Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here .
Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ?
Demographics say an average age of 28 . 7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year .
Yes , sir . Where to ?
Wangfujing , please !
All right .
Oh , I like the music on your radio . It's nice .
Thank you ! I always tune to this program when driving . So what's your favorite program ?
I like Winner's English very mush . You know the Beijing Olympic Games is right around the corner . We should learn English Well . It's on FM 96 . 6 , China Business Radio . You can get it on your radio too .
But I don't speak English at all .
That's OK . The program is especially for the beginners like us .
Really ? When is it on ?
It begins at 6:40 every morning , and it goes for 20 minutes .
Thank you so much . I'll try and catch that .
The radio has brought us lots of convenience .
Yes , I can also learn about the traffic condition through it .
With the development of the society and technology , radio is nearly everywhere .
So we should take the advantage of it .
It is 15 minutes ' drive .
What companies do we have in our neighborhood ?
Mitsubishi , HP , IBM and many other famous corporations .
Does the 7th floor belong to our company too ?
Yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building .
It ' s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ?
Yes , at the end of the hall .
Yes , could I make a reservation to New York on July 21st , next Friday ?
Sorry , there is no flight available on July 21st .
That's too bad . What's the earliest flight available ?
I can give you a reservation on flight No CZ 387 on July 22nd .
What about the fight schedule ?
It departs at 12:10 and arrives at 15:10 next day .
Is it a non-stop flight ?
Yes .
Sounds good . I'd like to take this flight .
Would you prefer first class or economy class ?
Economy class .
And your name , please ?
Edward Smith .

Yes , many thanks . Goodbye .
Bye .
Dear , let ' s drop the subject .
Yes . I ' m trying to find a pair of earrings to match my necklace . Can you recommend some to me ?
Yes . Your gold necklace has a diamond pendant , and your eardrops should be
These look wonderful . Do these come with a guarantee of quality ?
Of course . If there is anything wrong with them , you can come back and show me the guarantee of quality , and then you will surely get free service .
I ' ll take them .
What seems to be the problem ?
I have a rash that I need a doctor to look at .
Do you have a fever with that rash ?
No , it just itches a lot .

Of course not .
Why do you want to go to the US ?
I'd like to have further education . Now I am studying for my doctorate .
Will you get any kind of scholarship ?
Yes . The school has provided me with full scholarship and that will be enough to support myself .
I don't know what happened !
You cancelled the song , didn't you , Jack ?
No , I didn't . Really !
Then , is the machine broken or ...
Are you from a domestic flight or an international one ?
An international one from Seattle .
In that case , you should go to the baggage hall over there .
Oh yes , I see the sign , thank you .
Can I speak to Miss Cooper please ?
Would you hold on a second , please ? Miss Cooper's extension is engaged .
Engaged . Oh , dear ! Could you tell her it's a long-distance call ?
I'm sorry , sir . I can't interrupt her . I'm sure she won't be very long .
How long do you think she'll be ?
I really can't say how long she'll be .
Can I leave a message , please ?
Yes , certainly .
Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ?

Fever and a bad cough .
I see . Don't worry , just a common cold .

Patulin will be enough .
How many pills for each time ?
Nine pills per day , and three pills after each meal .
Thank you very much .
It's my pleasure .
Hi . Is there a special rate for a group reservation ?
Yes . There is a 20 % to 40 % discount . It depends on the season . During the summer the discount is 20 % . During the winter it is 40 % .
I need five single rooms in October . How much of a discount can I get ?
Our summer season ended in September . So the discount will be 40 % . That ' s a good deal . Would you prefer rooms with a front view or rear view ?
Front view , please .
What date and time will you be checking in ?
October 25th around 2:00 in the afternoon .
We need you to send a deposit for 1/3 of the bill . You can send the check , or you can use the credit card .
Ok . I ' ll send a check .
Could you tell me your name , address and phone number , please ?
Sure . My name is Anderson . My address is 109 Ferguson East , Holton . And my phone number is 309 789 1267 .
Thanks .
Yes , I would like to exchange some money .
what currency would you like to trade in ?
I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars . Do you accept $ 100 bills ?
No problem , we can accept any denomination . How much would you like to exchange today ?
Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ?
It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7 . 45RMB . If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7 . 35 . Will that be all right ?
I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow !
Oh , hello , Lucy . What's up ?
I'm afraid I can't come to work today , Mr . Smith .
Oh , what's wrong with you ?
I've got a fever and a very sore throat .
Well , you sound ill over the phone .
Yes . I have to stay in bed today , but I'll be able to come tomorrow .
That's all right . Have a good rest until you feel well enough .
Thank you , Mr . Smith . Goodbye .
Goodbye , Lucy .
That apartment never had any problems before . Are you sure the problem isn ' t you ?
We spoke with you the first week we moved in about things that you promised to fix .
Where do you think you have problems ?
There is no hot water , the bedroom has a broken window , and there are rats in the kitchen .
You know , no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before .
You are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment .
I will fix these problems when I get around to it .
I will be withholding my rent check this Friday unless these problems are addressed immediately .
You can ' t do that ! It ' s illegal !
Sorry , it ' s all sold out .
Well , do you have any for tomorrow ?
We have tickets for the matinee . It starts at 3p . m .
Ok . I ' ll take it .
Where would you like to sit ?
Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes .
Certainly .
Here you are . That will be five dollars . Anything else ?
Yes . I want some post cards and some airmail stamps . I want to send some letters to South America .
Just a moment , I'll look up the rate for air-mail letters to South America .
Can you tell me how much it will cost to send a package to Colombia ? Also , I what to know how long it will take .
Do you have the package with you ? I would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost .
Do you insure package ?
Yes . All you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for .
Is there a way that I can be sure that the people in South america receive my package ?
The post office rarely loses package . You can , however , request a rectum receipt .
One last question-what are your hours ?
We open at eight-thirty in the morning and close at five-thirty in the afternoon .
Thank you , you helped me a lot .
Congratulations , Bob ! That ' s great news , what ' s her name ?
We ' Ve named her Alice after my wife ' s grandmother .
That ' s a pretty name . Give your wife my best !
Linda , this is David Wang .
Hi , Mr . Wang , what can I help you with ?
I need to talk with Marry .
Certainly , hold on .
Thanks .
Do you have anything to declare ?
No , these are all my personal effects .
What's in the bag ? Would you mind opening the bag ?
Not at all . I don't know what's dutiable . Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use ?
NO . You don't have to pay duty on personal belongings .
Thank you .
I'm interested in taking a tour to Sydney .
Well , we have a package tour there .
How much does it cost ?
$ 600 .
Does that include the insurance ?
Of course .
Your achievement is obvious to all .
What we will do is to strengthen it .
Yes , this is also the competitive edge of our company .
You'll never be in shape until you eat less and take more exercise .
Now , tell me what you often eat .
I often eat fish and eggs .
Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
Oh yes , and fruits . I love fruits very much .
What do you like to drink ?
Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea .
Whatever would you like to drink ?
I drink a lot of milk . I drink milk almost every day .
How often do you exercise ?
Well , I walk every day .
It's a good diet and a regular exercise .
Yes , quite right .
I can ' t stand up ! My stomach is killing me !
Can you put your hand where it hurts the most ?
It hurts smack in the middle of my gut !
Did this just come on suddenly ?
I felt OK until an hour or so ago , and then I just doubled over .
Have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently ?
No , and I don ' t usually get a lot of stomachaches .
We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is .
I think that that is the best way to figure out what is causing this . Thank you .
No , I don't . I left it home .
Sorry , but we can't do anything without the receipt . Come back with it .
I didn't know . I'll go to get it . How late will you be open ?
Till 5:30 .
Of course not . We have 50 channels in all .
Well . I am afraid it must be my fault . Can you send someone here to help me ?
OK . I will send a maid to your room right now .
Let's take the bus .
I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .
It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .
It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .
We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .
Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .
If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?
We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi .
I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .
Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .
It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .
Thanks , that was nice of you .
See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !
I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ' m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself .
So , let ' s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ' Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ' t they ?
Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ' t need to be replaced .
How long did it take you to do the tiling .
As I hadn ' t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether .
I think you ' Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ?
You ' ll be lucky ! However , I ' ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself .
Just a minute . I need to make a list of thinks that we need .
Good idea . Have you written down potatoes , carrots , and onions ?
I don ' t have onions on my list . I ' ll add them . We should get some tea . Is green tea ok or should we get the same tea that we usually get ?
Let ' s get both . We need some coffee too . Is that on your list ?
Yes , it is . Here ' s my list . Is there anything that I ' Ve forgotten ?
I think you ' Ve got everything . I want to got some chocolate and some cheese .
What kind of cheese do you want .
I ' m not sure . I ' ll decide at the cheese counter , when I can see what they have . Have we got enough money ?
We don ' t have enough cash , so I ' ll take my credit card and we can pay with that . Where are the car keys ?
I ' Ve got them there . Shall I drive ?
Before we discuss the price , may I ask you what kind of exhibits you are interested in ?
Your summer clothes for white-collar and men's jackets .
Can you give us a rough idea of the quantity you require ? It is generally known that the price varies according to the quantity .
That is to say , 10000 sets for the one of white-collar and 5000 for men's jackets .
In that case , our offer for the white-collar series is US $ 200 , and the other is US $ 300 per set .
Do you quote CIF or FOB ?
We usually quote on a CIF basis and a commission of five percent for you . You will find our price is most competitive .
What are your terms of payment ?
Letter of credit at sight .
Another question . Could you tell me the earliest possible time of shipment ?
Within a month after your letter of credit reaches us .
Well , I got all the point . All the decision will be made since I get the approval from my supervisor .
OK ! I expect you to accept our general terms and conditions of trade . We believe that through our cooperation , large transactions will be brought to speedy conclusion .
What do you want to do ?
I want to get a puppy for my son .
That will make him so happy .
I'll get him one of those little dogs .
One that won't grow up too big .
And eat too much .
Do you know which one he would like ?
Oh , yes , I took him there yesterday . He showed me one that he really liked .
I bet you had to drag him away .
He wanted to take it home yesterday .
I wonder what he'll name it .
They're going skiing in Colorado .
What a coincidence ! These pajamas would be perfect to take along on the honeymoon !
You're probably right . Oh , what the heck ! I'll take it all ... in maroon , like you said .
No . I don ' t . Please .
Are you in robust health ?
I have a little problem , I'm overweight for my height . I think I should go on a diet .
Working under pressure is exciting and challenging . I don ' t mind working under pressure . I work well under that circumstance . People can , I can .
Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
No , nothing in particular .
How soon can you begin working for us ?
I need about two to three weeks for necessary formalities . I will quit then transfer to your company .
No , I'll have the fish please .
The chicken is also nice .
No , I want the fish .
Our special tonight is lobster .
Thank you , but I prefer the fish .
Perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb .
No , I like the fish .
What ever you say ?
Yes , it is . Thanks . I ' m just surfing on the internet .
Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ?
This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ' m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee !
That ' s great . Can you do it anywhere ?
No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
So , what programs do you have on your laptop ?
I ' Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs .
I know you are keen on photography . It ' s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at a
It ' s wonderful , isn ' t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I took recently ?
What kind do you have ?
We have Italian , French and Thousand Island .
Make it French please .
My name is Jeff .
What do you do ?
I ' m a podiatrist . What about you ?
I ' m a nurse . What do you do in your free time ?
I like to play piano , go bowling and chat with my friends . And you ?
I like to hang out with my friends , play games and go swimming .
Would you like to go out some time ?
Sure , that ' d be great . Where would you like to go ?
Anywhere with you .
Aren ' t you sweet .
I'm off to Barcelona for a week .
Do you have your passport with you ?
Yes , here you go . I don't need a visa to go to Spain , do I ?
Fortunately for you , you don't . Next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
That's good advice .
Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
Are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
Let me see here ... yes , there's one left .
Ok . I'll take that one then .
Alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
I like to travel light so I just have this one .
If that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?
Yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ?
You're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . Here's your boarding pass . Enjoy your flight !
Generally speaking , l am an open-minded person .
What is your strongest trait ?
Cheerfulness and friendliness .
How would your friends or colleagues describe you ?
They say Mr . Sun is a friendly , sensitive , caring and determined person .
What personality do you admire ?
I admire a person who is honest , flexible and easy-going .
How do you get along with others ?
I get on well with others .
Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long .
Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices .
That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options .
What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ?
Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into .
So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?
Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .
Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will .
After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ' m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice .
I have time to speak with you . Where would you like to purchase your house ?
I am most interested in Pasadena or Arcadia , but would be open to other suggestions .
How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need ?
We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home .
Do you need to be located in a particular school district ?
It doesn ' t matter , as we do not have any children .
Is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ?
In a perfect world , we would like a home with a view of the lake .
Thank you for all of the information . I will help you find the perfect house for you .
If I ordered a desk today , how would it be before I got delivery in Scotland ?
Well , I think perhaps you'd better speak to our Production Manager , Mr . Yao . You'll meet him when we go over to the factory .
Here you are .
Your seat is three , in the third row , near the window .
Thank you . Where can I put my suitcase ?
Either in the overhead compartment or underneath the seat .
Everyone's attention , please . We are going to take off . Please fasten your belts .
Yes . Where do you want to go ?
The Workers'Stadium .
This is the right bus .
Will you let me know where to get off ?
Certainly . Four more stop after this . I'll call out the stops .
Thank you .
Oh , dear . What was in it ?
All my money .
Well . Go to the police station and see if it ' s there .
Yes , there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it . Besides , you see , in recent years , we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness .
That's a good idea . We can improve our technology to meet your special need .
And please let white color dominate .
OK ! I've noted it down . And any others ?
Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city .
I'll tell them .
Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor .
Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery .
Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you .
I think so . Bye !
Bye !
We'd better stay in the hotel , because the tour will begin tomorrow .
Let's go out for some exercise , shall we ?
What an excellent idea !
Shall we do some jogging ?
OK .
I feel well now .
Yes , some exercise is necessary for us .
Quite right .
What are you going to cook ?
I haven't the slightest clue what I'm going to make .
A teriyaki bowl sounds nice .
I don't know how to make that .
All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef .
That sounds fairly simple , but how do I cook it ?
The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice .
What's next ?
Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it .
What's the next thing I need to do ?
Then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy .
Good morning I'd like to mail this box of books to Taiwan .
OK , please put it on this scale . Airmail or by sea ?
How long does it take to reach Taiwan by sea ?
Usually about two month .
That's too long . How long does it take to reach Taiwan by airmail ?
About ten days .
Then how much is that by airmail ?
Let me see . It ' s 57 dollars , 20 cents , including tax .
That's a little bit expensive .
Although it's expensive to send it by airmail , it's quicker and safer than by sea .
I guess I have to send it by airmail .
Do you want to ensure the contents , Miss ?
Yes , please .
Please fill out this form , also please write the value of the items in this space .
OK .
Take care ! I will miss you so much .
Again ?
That's right , even though I did set the alarm last night .
Your clock never works . Perhaps you should buy a new one .
Well , if it breaks down again tomorrow , I'll definitely buy a new one .
I know and they are really nice , too .
I ' ll have to get a couple in different colors .
Me , too .
Buy them now though , or they might not still be here tomorrow .
Good idea , especially at this price .
Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ?
Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ' m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg .
I don ' t know about that . with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ' t know if you ' re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ' s just too much instability . I wouldn ' t feel comfortable investing in this climate .
But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity . And anyway , I ' m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example . they have 1 . 4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .
Come on , son , you ' re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .
Fine , then ! If that ' s the way you feel , so be it . But you ' re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ' m going to go hit up Mum for the cash .
What do you think of the pamphlets with beautiful pictures ?
That's nothing new .
I'll buy an electric map of the city .
I'm getting sleepy .
You've had so long a flight .
Time difference also makes me feel weak .
Oh , I forgot about it .
It's four o'clock in the morning in Chicago now , but it's time to go to bed in Shanghai .
Don't think so much . Take a good sleep and you'll feel better soon .
I have no idea . What about you ?
I kind of want pizza .
I ate pizza the other day .
So , what do you feel like eating then ?
How about some burgers ?
I already had a burger yesterday .
What are we going to do ?
We can just each get what we want to get .
That sounds like a plan .
Do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ?
I think they sell both at the cafeteria .
I'm thinking of travelling to Suzhou in July . Could you recommend some tourist programs for that ?
With pleasure . We arrange two kinds of tourist programs for Suzhou , a six-day tour by train and a five-day flying journey .
How much does a six-day tour by train cost ?
Five hundred yuan .
Does that include hotels and meals ?
Oh , yes , and admission tickets for places of interest as well .
That sounds reasonable . What about the five-day flying journey ? How much is that ?
Eight hundred and fifty yuan .
Covering all expenses ?
Yes . But there is no half fare for children . They must pay full fare .
We have hundreds of constituencies and the voters in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ' s .
Each mp belongs to a political party , right ?
Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ' s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime Finist
What ' s a cabinet ?
This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ' s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
Can any mp make a law ?
Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law .
I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ' s . most mp ' s vote the way their party wants them to .
How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Voters who often change the party they vote for are Calle
It's wet and rains a lot . But right now it's the golden season to take a tour there . It is fine there almost everyday .
That's great . Will I feel hot there ? I feel sensitive to heat .
It's not so hot as it is here .
Sure . May I take your measurements ?
Please don't make it too tight . This is for autumn wear , so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath .
I see , sir . Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th , that's in a week's time ?
The 10th ? I'm sorry , but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th . Could you have the suit ready by the 8th , or at the latest , the 9th ?
Well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . But in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . How about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ?
That's fine , thank you .
You mean this one ?
No , the other one in the brown case .
Oh , this one ... Here .
May I try it ?
Sure .
It's very smooth . I'll take it .
Cash or charge ?
Charge , please .
Aisle A is where you'll find all the produce .
What sales do they have today ?
I'm sure something is on sale . Please check with the produce person .
Let me see . Here it is .
Could you tell me how to get there ?
I ' m afraid I can ' t because I ' m a stranger here .
Oh , thanks all the same .
Not at all . You can ask the policeman over there .
Hi ! Let me get a dozen croissants , four blueberry muffins and a loaf of sourdough bread .
Sure . Would you like to have the loaf sliced ?
No , that's OK . Do you have any whole wheat bread ?
We are out at the moment . May I suggest some rye bread ?
Sure that sounds good . Do you have any cakes ?
We have various birthday cakes and also ice cream cakes .
I'll just take a cheesecake .
Will that be all ?
Yes .
Your total is forty three dollars and twenty cents .
The buck stops here .
Good afternoon , could you connect this call with Mr Brown , please
May I know who's calling ?
This is Li Ping of ABC computer company limited . I'm calling on our Mr Wilson the general manager of our company .
I'm sorry , Mrs Li , Mr Brown is now in a meeting . May I have your number , and ask him to call you back later ?
I'm afraid Mr Wilson would like to speak to Mr Brown right now . He ' s got an urgent matter to discuss with Mr Brown without delay .
Ok , then would you please hold the line ? Mr Li , the line is through , Mr Brown is ready answering the call , go ahead .
Thank you for your assistance , Mr Bush .
You are welcome .
Thank you .
Did you work as a salesperson before , Mrs . Vale ?
Only as a clerk in a store .
I see . Well , consulting is a little different .
I'm a quick leamer , Mr . Jenkins .
Umm hmm . Do you have a diver's license ?
Yes , and I'm a very good driver .
Fine . We provide a company car for our consultants .
Do I have to travel a lot ?
Oh yes-five days a week . You have to visit customers all over the territory .
But how will I get to know the products ?
You'll have to attend a three-week course . If you do well , the job is yours .
How much is the salary ?
Starting salary is $ 150 a week-plus commissions , of course .
How much commission do your consultants get ?
Five percent .
Well , I'm very interested in the job .
Fine . The next course starts a week from tomorrow .
Thank you .
Good luck to you .
It was a nightmare .
What ' s up ?
Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?
Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout .
This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ?
I am still waiting for their call .
Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward .
Yes , I would like a roast duck and my friend wants steaks .
How do you like your steaks ?
I'd like it medium-well .
OK , sir , wait a minute .
Right . I'd like to deposit 2,000 RIB into my Current Account .
No problem . Could I have the cash and your Bank Book , please ? Oh dear ... there seems to be some problems here ...
What ? What's wrong ?
I'm sorry but 5 of these notes seem to be counterfeit . Look at this watermark , do you see it ?
It does look a little strange , I didn't notice that before .
Why not ? It's my parking space .
I'm afraid not , sir .
Oh ? That's a surprise . Let me see ... D 0411 Our dog's birthday . Yes , I'm sure this my parking space !
But I saw a red car always parking here before .
Oh , we've just repainted our car . It was red .
Maybe . But the car of this space has a broken rearview mirror on the left .
Yeah . It used to . We got that fixed yesterday too .
Could you wait for a minute , sir ? I'd like to have a check .
Sure , go ahead .
Sorry , sir , my mistake . This is your parking space .
That's all right . It's not your fault .
Oh , is there ? Which room is it ?
It's . I think , neighbours on the right .
You mean the room thirteen-thirteen ?
I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhausted , but I can't sleep .
All right , ma'am . I'll check and tell them to be quiet .
If next room is still noisy , could you give me a different room , please ?
Well , I'll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office .
Shall we meet at 1:15 this Thursday ? We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .
Fine , I'll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday .
They turned me down .
Why ? You are so excellent .
I think the only reason is that I was too nervous during the interview and I couldn't express myself the way I wanted to .
What a shame ! You should have showed yourself to them !
It doesn't matter . I'll try other companies .
I suggest you hunt for a job on the Internet .
On the Internet ? I've never heard of it .
It's very convenient and it has become popular recently .
Is that safe ?
Of course , if you log on some standard websites .
Thank you for your advice . I'll have a try .
Sure . What's it , Yvonne ?
I want to put my desk over there , but it's too heavy for me to move .
Okay , you take one end and I'll take the other .
They'll be ready by this afternoon .
Oh , no ! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning .
Is that right ? We're very sorry .
I thought it was " the same day " service . Anyway , please do hurry .
I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock .
Well , then , would you send it to Japan , please ?
Yes , we'll do so .
Jane , I ' m on the other line , can you hang on for a second ?
Sure .
OK , I ' ll be right back .
This is Mr Brown speaking . I'd like to speak to Mr . Thomas , please .
I'm sorry , but Mr . Thomas left the office a few minutes ago .
That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy . Will he be back soon ?
I'm afraid not . He's gone for the rest of the day .
Is there anywhere I can reach him ?
I don't believe so . He's going out of town on business . May I take a message ?
I have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , but I'm afraid I can't make it .
Would you care to make another appointment ?
Unfortunately , I'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and I may be gone for several days .
I see . I can tell Mr . Thomas that you phoned .
Thank you .
Bye-bye .
Yes , hello , I would like to make a reservation please .
Certainly sir , For which day and time please ?
Tonight at seven .
I'm sorry sir , but we are fully booked tonight until eight .
In that case , eight o'clock is fine .
Very well , and how many people will attend tonight ?
Four people .
Lastly , may I please know what name I should make the reservation under ?
Mark .
I am going to buy some food to cook for supper .
Good . I wanna come with you .
How strange ! Our little emperor now asks to help out with shopping .
We learnt about vegetables and meat at school . But I never see the real thing .
Wow , that's something new . Let's go ! What's this , honey ?
Er , is it cabbage ?
Cabbage ? Is that what they teach at school now ? OK , honey , it's spinage .
Yeah , I know , this is Popeye's favorite food .
There we go .
Mom , come here . I know this , it is carrot , am I right ?
Bingo ! It's dark outside , Let's hurry up .
It ' s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . Nobody sticks around in the summer .
Really ? Then , I guess I won ' t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
Actually , you might because there ' s a big convention in town this weekend .
I ' m not too worried about it . I always seem to find something .
Right . Then you may think that I am not fit for this job according to my educational background .
Yes .
But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate .
So you must be an extravert ?
Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them .
What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ?
A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment .
Don't you consider it a hard work ?
Hard but interesting , I think .
Have you any experience as a tourist guide ?
Yes , I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University .
Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English ?
Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well .
Okay . Do you have a particular size in mind ?
Well , the bigger the better , I think .
Look at this one . It's our biggest pan .
Yes , that is big enough , but it's too heavy for me .
Okay , we have the same thing in aluminum .
Oh , this is nice and light . But it has an aluminum handle .
Try this one . Same aluminum pan , but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle .
Oh , yes . This is very nice . I'll take this one .
That's a good choice . How do you want to pay for it ?
Cash . Oh , I almost forgot . I need a lid , too .
I'm so sorry . A lid comes with the pan . Here it is .
Thanks , doctor . Is there anything I can take for this headache ?
Some aspirin or Panadol should help . You can pick some up at the pharmacy when you go to fill your prescription .
Okay .
Goodbye , Randy . Take care .
I spoke to a girl named Claire on the phone ; it's about losing my card and everything .
What I need you to do first is fill in these forms , with as much detail as possible . Then we can get you a new card .
So , I can get my new card today ?
I'm sorry , Sir , the full procedure can take up to 7 days to process everything .
7 days ! What am I supposed to do for money until then ?
If you bring some ID with you , it's possible for you to make a withdrawal over the counter if you need to . But unfortunately , without your new card you cannot use the ATM , so all withdrawals must be made within working hours .
What can I do for you ?
I've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed .
What's your flight number ?
Flight CA216 to Chengdu .
Yes , it's true . It has been delayed .
Could you please tell me why ?
Yes , of course . The delay is due to heavy rain .
How long will the delay be ? Do you have any further information about it ?
I am sorry , we don't know the extent of the delay at present . But according to the latest weather forecast , there will be a change in weather soon .
We have to wait . Well , is it possible for the rain to stop before noon ?
It's hard to say . Weather is so changeable in the summer . Please listen to the latest announcement about your flight .
Yes , I will . Thanks a lot . Bye !
Bye
Yes , at your company , I think . I'm Frank .
Oh , I remember now . Very nice to meet you again .
Nice meeting you , too .
So you have to open all the envelopes .
Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly .
Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas .
I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails .
So you have to open all the envelopes .
Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly .
Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas .
I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ?
Come on ! In the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song !
I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night .
Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him . He loves " The King . "
I'll put the song at the front of the list .
Yes , that's right . We want as much info as possible before we agree to anything .
Yes , it's important to be all clued up before you enter into any agreement . To make full use of the Network Settlement Service and take advantage of the whole banking system , we provide internal fund transfers , account inquiry , agency clearing to name but a few .
So , do you think our corporation will be eligible for this ?
Yes , and it's extremely simple . All you need to do is make a Network Settlement Agreement with us .
yes , doesn't everyone ?
what's your favorite animal ?
it's hard to say . While dogs are more affectionate , cats are much easier to take care of .
have you ever had a dog ?
when I was little , we had a few domestic dogs at home .
they always say that dogs are a man's best friends . do you think that's true ?
definitely . rich or poor , dogs always love their masters .
how about cats ? Have you ever had one for a pet ?
i had one a few months ago , but she ended up running away .
how did that happen ?
she left through a window that was open one night and never returned .
you must have been devastated !
i was pretty sad . i still hope that she'll return some day !
I hope she does . Do you think you'll ever get another pet ?
I think I will . It's difficult to feel longly when you have a pet around .
i hope your cat finds its way back home .
i do , too .
Yes . It's a feast of eyes to walking in the museum .
Let's take our time and enjoy the art and sprite of the famous museum .
What a shame that we can't take pictures .
I will join John in his mountaineering trip .
Woo cool . Which mountain are you going to conquer ?
We haven't made up our minds . Will you come with us ?
Of course , I will .
Yes sir , just a minute , please . I ' ll check with the kitchen . Thank you for waiting . It takes another 10 to 15 minutes , I ' m afraid .
I have an appointment in half an hour .
I see .
Do you have anything else I can have instead ?
Well sir , yes . How about this stew ? We can serve you at once .
I ' ll take this stew then .
Yes , one last thing . How much holiday time do you give your employees every year ?
Our employees receive fifteen days of paid vacation every year . If you don ' t use the full fifteen days , they carry over to the following year .
How about sick days ?
You get five paid sick days .
Any other benefits ?
Yes , we have an excellent retirement plan and medical insurance as well .
Great . Thanks so much for your time .
We ' ll contact you soon , Ted . Thanks for coming in .
That's good to hear . You've had an ideal recovery from your operation . We're going to send you home tomorrow .
Do you think I can get back to work very soon ?
Don't be in such a hurry . I'm confident that you'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks .
Is there anything I should do ?
You'd better have a good rest for a week . Be sure to have regular meals . Stay away from alcohol . Give up smoking at least a little while .
Should I take some medicine ?
Yes . I'm going to give you some . Take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . For that one , two tablets . And remember to come to the out patient department for a consultation in two weeks , please .
It's very kind of you .
You're welcome . We wish you a speedy recovery . Goodbye .
We need lots of things . I ' ll make a list . We need a bag of sugar , a loaf of bread and a crate of beer .
A crate of beer ? Why do we need that ?
Just joking . I would like to get a few bottles of beer though . We also need a liter of cooking oil .
we can buy a three-liter bottle . It works out cheaper per liter . We should buy a packet of butter and a few pints of milk too .
I ' d like to get a jar of strawberry jam and a bottle of tomato ketchup . Do we need any meat ?
I think we should get half a kilo of minced beef and a few pork chops .
Ok . Let ' s not forget fruit and vegetables . We need a bunch of bananas , a kilo of tomatoes and a bag of potatoes .
We should also get a tube of toothpaste and a bar of soap . Let ' s get a tub of ice cream too . We can treat ourselves .
Ok . We should get a few tins of tuna . Anything else ?
I ' d like a few cans of coke . We also need a dozen eggs and half a dozen sausages .
let ' s get a chunk of cheese too . Is that everything .
I think so . I ' Ve got the shopping list , so let ' s go .
Driving ? No way , it's too far .
I just thought it would be an interesting way to see lots of places . How long will it take ?
Too long , and you do not have much time .
What a pity .
I feel kind of stupid .
Why ?
We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet .
You got lost . You're kidding !
No . We took a wrong turn somewhere . And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions . But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost .
You could have called .
I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were .
You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ?
Guess where we ended up .
I don't know . Where ?
When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield .
Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ?
I don't know . The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
I know it is . I don't know how it happened .
Hmm , maybe I do .
What ?
Maybe I have an idea how it happened .
How ?
You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road .
Oh , that's what you think , huh ?
Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ?
Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly .
I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable .
I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .
I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % .
I ' m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ?
We've already cut down our price to cost level .
Is that all ?
Yes , this is the best we can do .
I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered .
oh , yes . I want to check whether you still have any vacancies . I need three single rooms for next Monday .
ok . There're vacancies . Since the peak season is coming , it's advisable to book soon . Would you like to make a reservation now ?
yes , please . Do you take credit cards ?
yes , we accept all major credit cards .
and how about Internet access ?
there's free Internet access in the lobby .
is it available in the rooms ?
Unfortunately not .
that's OK . Is breakfast included ?
yes , breakfast is included and parking is available .
fantastic . Thank you very much .
you're welcome . And we have 24 hour reception . Please don't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions .
Yes .
What's your name ?
My name is James .
What's your nationality ?
American .
What's your relationship with the victim ?
I don't know him .
Why did you attack the victim ?
Because he beat me first when I tried to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away .
How many times did you stab the victim ?
I stabbed his belly three times .
Did you know hat your actions might cause serous injuries or death ?
I knew , but I couldn't control myself .
Was it your intention to kill the victim ?
No . I didn't kill him on purpose , madam . It's him who caused the incident . I need to see my attorney .
OK . Give me his number and we'll contact him .
You've been sneezing a lot lately . Are you sick or something ?
No . Every spring time around April , I'm stricken with allergies .
I never have seasonal allergies .
Consider yourself lucky .
What are all the symptoms ?
Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water .
That doesn't sound good .
No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ?
Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family .
Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol .
I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body .
That's pretty bad .
But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah .
That's all right . I can manage .
Be careful ! The road is muddy . You might slip .
Thanks for the warning .
Yes , I ' m enquiring about your advertisement for a sales manager in today ' s newspaper . Is this position still open ?
Yes , but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
Yes , I have a lot of previous experiences in sales . I worked in sales departments for two companies since I finished my university .
That sounds fine . Please give me your name and phone numbers . I ' ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . It will most likely be in a couple of days . Is it all right for you ?
Yes , my name is Brian and my phone number is 5294870 .
Thank you .
Yeah , I ' Ve been meaning to talk to you about that . I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline .
You ' Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ?
Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . .
I ' m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time !
I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ' t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures .
I ' m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP !
You will receive a Notice of Unemployment Insurance Award letter .
What will that tell me ?
The Award Letter will tell you how much you will receive weekly .
Are there any other forms that I need to fill out ?
You will need to fill out a Continued Claim Form every two weeks .
What information will I need to provide on that form ?
They will need to know where you worked and how much money you made .
Are there any other questions on the form ?
Basically , they want to know that you were available for work and not sick .
Can't I play more ?
No ! Stop playing computer games !
Mom , I'll be finished soon .
Peter , if you don't turn off your computer , then I won't allow you to play it again starting next week .
I'm not sure . I was thinking of making a vegetable .
What kind of vegetable are you thinking about making ?
Do you know what kind of vegetable you want to eat ?
Why don't you make some corn ?
How would you like the corn ?
I don't understand what you mean .
Do you want it boiled , grilled , or microwaved ?
Why don't you grill it ?
That's how you want it ?
Yeah , that sounds delicious .
Okay , I'll grill some corn then .
how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym .
that's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
me , too . What did you have in mind ?
I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must .
I agree . They're very lovely , especially " Huan Huan " .
is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ?
the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive .
oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ?
I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now .
any other ideas ?
there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts .
it all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have .
One second , sir , while I print out your receipt . Here you are .
Thanks .
May I ask , sir , if you enjoyed your stay ?
Well , except for one night , I enjoyed the hotel . And I loved New York , of course .
Thank you for your honesty . I assure you there will be no cockroaches next time .
It's about twelve hours .
Can you tell me what time we're arriving ?
Sure . Let me see ... at 6:15 a . m . local time .
I see .
And that'll be 10:15 p . m . Beijing time .
Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff .
I see . And how about the working hours ?
Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times .
Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ' s not really a shock for me .
Good , as long as you understand that .
And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ?
Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month .
That sounds ideal .
I always love skiing . You know , it's a cool game for cool people . Stay with me and you will be cool , too .
Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .
Sure . It's probably the skiing show . Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
See that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .
Hey , don't be so pathetic . It's a maximal sports show . What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ?
They are all very experienced and great skiers . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow in here ?
Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ?
Hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist .
Sorry . Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .
Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
It's possible . But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
It's a good thing . OK , let's go skiing .
Here we go .
Let me see .
Sure , what do you want me to tell them ?
Well , I need to confirm the time of their classes .
Ok , where can I find their telephone number ?
They are all listed here on this sheet of paper .
Is it their home , office or cell phone numbers ?
Unless it ' s marked differently , it ' s their home numbers .
Alright . What if I can ' t get a hold of them by phone ?
Then , you should e-mail them with the information .
Where can I find their e-mail addresses ?
They should have then listed on their resumes .
And if there aren ' t any e-mail addresses ?
Then send them a SMS on their cell phone .
Ok . That sounds easy enough . Have you called any of them yet ?
Yes . I called the first three people on the list , but they didn ' t pick up .
Did you leave a voice message ?
I left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list .
I see . What did you tell her ?
I told her that she should call me back at my office number .
Ok , so , maybe I should call her again .
Yes , that sounds like a good idea . She might not get the other message in time .
One more question . It looks like some of these numbers are long-distance . Do you have a calling card that I can use to get through to them ?
Sure . You can use this one . The pin number is written on the back of the card .
Alright . Thanks a lot . Don ' t worry . I ' ll take care of it .
Great work . I ' m off for the weekend ! See you on Monday .
See you .
We'd like to order breakfast for tomorrow morning .
Yes , sir . What would you like ?
Orange juice , scrambled eggs , bacon , toast and coffee .
OK , and when shall I bring it here ?
About seven thirty . By the way , could you also bring me tomorrow's papers ?
Of course , sir .
Yes . I need some ice water delivered .
Are you completely out ?
No , I have some , but not enough for the long weekend .
Okay . I ' ll send someone to deliver it for you tomorrow .
Thank you .
No problem .
Can't complain . And you ?
Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How's your schedule look ?
Let me see . I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday .
Great .
Yes , millions of travelers come here every year for the view of the buildings .
The journey is worth while . Where are we going after this ?
We will visit the Statue of Liberty as scheduled .
That's fine . You must try this dish .
Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ?
It's fish steamed and served with our special sauce .
Is it good ?
Sure . It's a most popular dish .
I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together .
We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ?
What kind do you have ?
We have French and Thousand Island .
Make it Thousand Island .
I'm not sure , what about you ?
Do you think Kentucky fried chicken is good ?
Sure sounds good to me .
Hello , this is Quinn from IBA .
Ah , hello Quinn . Oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , aren't you ?
I'm afraid so , yes .
Hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! Is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ?
Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake .
What do you recommend we do ?
I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible .
I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now .
As a reporter , he must have acute insight and language skills . At the same time , he must have good judgment , the respect for his job and tactical cooperation with others .
Can you work under pressure ? You know , people working here are all busy everyday since we're daily newspaper .
I think I've got used to work under pressure . I will adjust myself to the step of your newspaper quickly .
What ' s stopping you ?
I ' m not sure how .
I don ' t understand .
I ' Ve never used one before .
I can help you figure it out .
What do I have to do ?
Slide your card into the machine .
Then what ?
You need to type your PIN in .
What do I have to do next ?
Click on whichever option you want , and you ' re done .
Hi there , I ' m Bill Gotcha , the owner of Gotcha Enterprises . Did you find your way here OK ?
Your assistant gave wonderful directions .
Why are you switching jobs at this point in your career ?
Our Company is moving overseas and I wish to stay in the United States .
What are you best at ?
I am good at organizing systems that have been having problems .
What is your biggest challenge in terms of skills ?
I don ' t like to sit around and so like to always find things to do to keep myself busy .
That is good to hear !
Yes , how do I get to your shop from Chilin ?
Go straight up Zhongshan Road and you will see our sign on your right , after you pass the museum .
Thank you very much .
Here you are .
For business or pleasure ?
Business .
Thank you . Have a pleasant stay .
Yes . Flight DB117 departs at 5:38 pm and arrives in New York at 6:00 am with a layover in Chicago . It also makes a refueling stop at Colombia .
So many stops ! Don't you have any direct flights ?
Sorry sir , it is the only flight wa have right now .
I ' d rather you didn ' t , Miss Yang . I ' m very busy now .
Can I try later then ?
Yes , of course .
Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ?
Well , uh ... I ' m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ?
Do you mind if I sit down ?
Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ?
I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ?
Yes . But why should you want to do that ?
Do you mind if I speak frankly ?
Not at all . Go ahead .
Well . You see , I don ' t like the office . I don ' t like the staff . And I ' m afraid of you . And I don ' t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ?
Yes . I ' d be delighted if you did .
I think it ' s great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I ' Ve actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine ' s for a while now , but I wasn ' t sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment .
Um , ninety-five dollars ?
Yes , that ' s the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ?
I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen ' s Boutique . I didn ' t know I could get it cheaper somewhere else .
Of course ! Everything at Helen ' s is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn ' t you shop around ?
I don ' t know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive .
Just a moment and I'll check . We ' re expecting a delivery on Friday . We've only got ten in stock at the moment . I can deliver those by first thing tomorrow morning . There'll be an extra charge for special delivery . I'll have to send them by courier .
Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day .
Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then .
What about cats ? They are more independent .
Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat .
How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ?
Yeah , are they easy to look after ?
Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything .
$ 19 a day or $ 129 a week , unlimited mileage .
Could I have one for tomorrow morning ?
Could I see your driver's license ?
Sure here it is .
Good . Now just complete this form .
That's nice .
We hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings .
Of course not . We have cooperated for a long time .
I'd like to leave this bag with you .
OK , sir . Is there anything valuable or breakable in it ?
Well ... there is a necklace in it .
Would you mind taking the necklace with you , or leaving it at the safe deposit box ?
Well , don't bother . I'll take it with me . Will that be all right ?
Thank you , sir . Here is your tag . This cloakroom is open till 11:00 p . m . , could you pick it up by then ?
Sure . thank you .
Sorry , We don't take returns on sale items .
This is Mrs Smith . Can I help you ?
I am calling to say thank you for the interview yesterday .
You are welcome . I am very impressed by your capability .
Is there anything I should do ?
No , nothing . It's thoughtful of you to call me again .
Thank you . Please call me at any time if you have any questions .
Ok , I will . Do you have any question ?
No , thank you . Goodbye .
Goodbye .
Curry and rice . What do you think ?
That sounds nice . I can peel the potatoes first .
Really ! Oh , honey , you are so sweet . I'll chop up this carrot .
Mom , the water is boiling !
Honey , just turn down the stove .
Hi , Nacy . Come in please . I'm just putting away on my books .
So , you are leaving , aren't you ?
yes , I'm going to take a holiday tomorrow .
How nice ! I can see you are busying packing . I'm sorry to interrupt you .
That's all right . I'm almost finished . Do you need my help ?
Yes , could you please go over this for me ? and see if there is any mistake in it ?
Oh . all right I'll read it soon .
Excuse me for taking your time .
It's nothing Navy .
You need to take a break , maybe a vacation .
Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment .
Is that so ?
Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .
Have you decided ?
Yes . I want to get a better job .
Could you tell me why you want to quit ?
I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?
I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .
OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
Thank you so much for your advice .
And every best wish for your new job .
Thank you .
Well . Have you got his permission ?
Yes . We have an appointment at eight o ' clock .
What ' s your name , please ?
Robert . Philips Robert .
About what ?
I want to speak to you about this year ' s election .
Oh , really ?
Yes , I am a volunteer for the campaign .
I am very impressed .
I feel that history is about to be made , and I want to be a part of it .
That is very nice of you .
Will you be voting ?
Yes , I am going to vote .
Make sure you make it to your polling place early on Election Day .
Thank you and good luck .
Is it my turn ?
Yes , please sit on the chair . How do you want to have your hair cut ?
Not too long . Cut a little off behind and on both sides , too .
OK . Now lean back a little and keep still . I'm going to shave your face .
Yes , please .
Which type of gas do you want ? Regular , Super , or Premium Unleaded ?
What's the price difference ?
Regular is $ 1 . 15 , Super is $ 1 . 25 and Premium is $ 1 . 39 .
Just fill it up with Regular , Unleaded , please .
Do you want me to check the tires and the fluids ?
Yes , I would . Thanks a lot .
Hello , this is the apartment manager speaking .
I'm calling about the apartment for rent on Main Street .
Would you be interested in seeing the apartment ?
I would love to see it .
Are you free today at around 6 p . m . ?
Yes , I will be able to make it then .
Well , I'll see you at 6 p . m . Do you know how to get there ?
I used to live in that area .
I'll give you an application form when I see you .
That sounds good . Do I need to bring anything ?
No . Just bring yourself .
Yes , I am . I always make a plan before I do anything .
Where do you want to be in 5 years ?
I don't want to have a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing .
That sounds very reasonable .
It's the most important thing to me .
If you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ?
That obviously depends on how things go - - whether I'm suited to the firm and the firm to me .
Tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them .
I want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . In order to achieve this goal , I just want to work step by step .
What is your long-range objective ?
I haven't thought it over at all .
What do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ?
I think the most important thing is the interest in the job .
Non-smoking , please .
Hello . I'm not sure who I need to speak to . I got this 50 yuan note today and it seems a little odd to me .
The first thing we do is check the feel of the paper ;d oes it feel too thick or too thin ? Then we check the watermark . In my opinion it is counterfeit . I'll just run it through the scanner to double check .
What happens now ?
Well , it's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . So , unfortunately you'll lose this 50 RIB . We'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
All right , Bill . Here ' s your daily exercise schedule . You are to jog before breakfast .
Jog ?
Then , you are to walk to work .
Walk ?
Thirty minutes in gym at lunch time .
Oh no .
Use the stairs , never the elevator .
Oh , dear .
And three times a week , you can either swim , play racketball , or hand ball .
Oh no .
OK , you can stop now . It ' s time for the dance class .
Dance class ! I don't know how .
You will .
Oh ...
The next bus will be here in four minutes .
Oh , good . That'll be the number forty four ?
No , it's the number fifty-eight .
So when's the next forty-four ? Will it be here soon ?
No , it won't .
So when will it be here then ?
Never .
Never ?
That's right . The number forty-four doesn't stop here any more . Its stop is round the corner .
There are many stores selling handcrafts in Paris . Our store is wellknown for vase , table wear and jewelry boxes . You can take your time and choose whatever you like .
Well , the tapestry is delicate and beautiful .
You have made an excellent choice , it is our newcomer . The tapestry is on hot sell with the design and quality . The design on it is traditional Paris architecture .
How much is it ?
100 frances .
Mmm , it is reasonable . Look at this set of table wear , it is so beautiful !
We have a piece of table clothing to go with it . It is a brocade one with pretty stars .
This silver vase is a good ornament for the living room .
You are right .
I will take the tapestry , the set of table wear and the vase .
OK . Do you like these candles ? They are on sale now .
All right . I will take one .
Of course , that's my job . Oh , dear . What's happened ?
Well , it's eaten my card ! It won't give it back !
I see ... calm down , don't worry . May I ask what were you doing when it took your card ?
Yes . I was only entering my PIN . I'm terrible at remembering it , I'm so forgetful , you see .
Mmmm ... and exactly how many times did you enter it , please ?
Maybe three times . As I said , I always forget it .
Ah ! Don't worry ; it's just a security measure . If someone uses a card and cannot get the right PIN after three attempts , the bank keeps the card in case it's stolen . Just contact the bank and we'll get it back to you .
Oh , I see . So if I call my branch they can sort everything out for me ?
Yes , they'll be happy to help . Believe me , it happens to many people .
I'd better try harder to memorise my PIN in future . Thanks .
Yeah , Why ?
You look quite mature beside your cousin who is eighteen .
You can bet on that .
I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company .
This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you .
Thank you , I will be doing my best .
I got stuck in a traffic jam .
Hurry up , the show is about to start .
It looks like you're very interested in the circus .
Yes , I love to see the animal show .
I have never seen those before , but since you're so excited it should be good .
I'm sure you'll love it .
Okay , I will go and get some popcorn first .
Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually .
What about supply of parts to the production line ?
Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line .
What about the smaller components ?
They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory .
It'll be $ 65 for a monthly pass .
Is there anything cheaper than that ?
If you're in school , you can get a student pass .
Well , I am how much will that cost ?
The pass is free .
I don't have to pay for anything ?
You'll only have to pay for the monthly sticker .
How much is the monthly sticker ?
It's $ 24 for each month .
I'll take the student bus pass .
Okay , I'll get you one .
Sorry . I didn't mean to .
You mean the network connection ?
Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response for any click .
I have the same question . I can ' t send out mails . We ' d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately .
Ok .
Good . I'll take care of it .
Wait a second , Vince . You know what ? Why don't you let me handle it ?
Are you sure ? Do you have somebody in mind ?
Yeah . Let me see if he'll do it , and I'll get back to you .
OK . Just keep in mind it has to be somebody who can get along with Elvin .
Don't sweat it . I know just the guy .
I used to hold a similar job for six years .
So you're quite confident in your experience and skill
I think so .
I have confidence in you . Believe in yourself .
Yes . Are you ?
I will be voting tomorrow .
What ' s your polling place ?
My polling place is at the park up the street .
Oh , yeah ?
Yeah , where is yours ?
I don ' t know .
How is it you don ' t know ?
The location of my polling place never came in the mail .
You can always just check online .
Let me go do that .
We are sorry , but single rooms have been occupied .
What's the room rate ? It is a little expensive for me , do you have any other rooms ?
Then how about this room , with just shower ?
May I see the room ? I ' ll take this room . Is the rate for the room only ?
No , sir . The tax is included .
Why don't you have any money for another bus ?
I got hungry and bought some chips .
That was smart .
Anyway , do you have any change I can use for the bus ?
I don't have any .
I don't know how I'm going to get home .
Get a transfer from the bus driver .
How much is a transfer ?
It doesn't cost anything .
That's great ! Thanks for your help .
You know what ? Don't mention it .
No , I'm not .
What are you going to do ? Are you going to work late ?
No , I'm not . I'm going to look for an apartment .
An apartment ? Why ?
I'm going to try to find a place near the office .
Where are you living now ?
Out in the suburbs . It's a long trip to work every day .
How are you going to find an apartment ?
I'm going to buy a newspaper and check the classified ads .
Apartments in the city are expensive .
I know , but I'm going to enroll in a night school to take a course in business management .
Do you realize that all these shoes are half off ?
Really ?
Yes , but the offer only lasts this week .
Sure , but you have to pay $ 3 for it .
OK . Here you are .
Well , ou can't hear music until takeoff .
I see . Thank you .
This is Mr Meng speaking , Michelle .
Oh , hello ! Sorry about that . I'm just calling to say that we've received your new Corporate Credit Card from HQ .
That was quick ! I wasn't expecting it until later this week .
Yes , our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast-track system .
Shall I come in and collect it ?
Or we can send it to you . But if you would like to use it at the ATM , you'll need to wait for your PIN number .
Mmmm ... if I come in and collect it this afternoon , is there any way I could use it today ? Petty cash is getting low , so I need to draw some money .
As long as you bring your ID , etc , we can serve you over the counter . But you won't be able to use the ATM until your new PIN number arrives .
I see . Yes , that's fine . I'll be there at around 2:30 pm . See you later , and thanks .
We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days .
Why , your price has soared . It ' s almost 25 % higher than last year ' s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price .
I ' m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere .
I ' m afraid I can ' t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ' Ve received from other sources .
But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ' s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries .
I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ' s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ' t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ' t changed much over the years .
There ' s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ' s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price .
Well , we ' ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ' ll have to try , I suppose .
Why are you trying to rush me off the phone ?
I really have to go .
Why ? I still wanted to talk to you .
I have things to do .
Like what ?
Don't be nosey .
I'm not . I just want to know .
Well , it's really none of your business .
That's harsh .
I'm sorry , but I have to go .
Fine .
My goodness ! It ' s the afternoon ? Doesn ' t the time fly ! Do come in and sit down .
Thank you .
What ' s the time ? My watch has stopped .
It ' s half past twelve .
When do you have lunch ?
From one to two .
What do you normally eat ?
We usually go to the cafeteria .
Oh , it ' s time to have lunch now .
let ' s go together .
We're here today to present to you the results of our marketing research regarding the consumer behavior .
I would like to begin by introducing our foreign guests to our stuff on your left ( right ) , we have Mr . Brown , who is Vice President of Sales . Next to him is Ms . Arts , Director of Marketing for the Atlas Company . In the back row is Dr . Barolo , who is visiting from Italy . Thank you all for coming .
I am glad to see everyone is here and on time . Let's get started ! Susan , toss out some of your ideas .
Why do you need to leave early ?
I don ' t feel so good .
What doesn ' t feel right ?
I feel as if I am going to be sick to my stomach .
Perhaps you should get checked out at the Student Health Center before you go home .
I have some medicine at home that I could take .
Are you going to be OK to drive home , or would you like someone to go with you ?
Thank you , but my friend is in the library , and he can give me a ride home .
We hope that you are feeling better soon . E-mail me if you have any questions .
A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ?
The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend .
So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ?
It sounds like it will be .
I really hope it doesn't get cold .
That would ruin things , I want to go so badly .
The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know .
That is true . The weather is constantly changing .
It would be nice if the weather would never change .
That would be great , then we could plan things sooner .
True . Predictable weather would make life easier .
Not at all . I ' m an agnostic . do you ?
I ' m not sure . Why don ' t you believe there is a god ?
I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one .
I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ' t explained yet .
I ' m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong .
For example ?
Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics .
Yes . Such people don ' t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs .
Yes , please . I'm here for an International Settlement . Our company has to effect payment , and it needs to be done today . Here's the advice slip for the payment .
Thanks . I'm sorry to say that you need to get this stamped . There is no stamp on this slip and it is essential before I can process it for you .
I see . So , I need to stamp it . And sign it too ?
Yes , that's right . Down here , at the bottom right hand corner to show that you agree to pay the printed amount .
I'll go back to the office and get it sorted and pop back later . Thanks , bye for now .
What is that problem , sir ?
There are cockroaches in my room .
Are you sure , sir ? Flies I could believe , but cockroaches ?
I've counted nine different cockroaches , and I accidentally stepped on another one .
Sir , we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel .
You dare to doubt me ?
I'm sorry , sir . Let me transfer you to my supervisor .
Take a guess .
Honey , I have a lot of work to do .
So you can't go with us , right ?
No .
Daddy , you always arrange your schedule so tight on weekdays . You should have a rest on weekends .
What park do you want to go to ?
Daniel wants to go to the aquarium . While Mom wants to visit the Summer Palace .
Haven't we been these places already ?
Yeah . I don't agree with them , but I don't have a better choice .
What about the Olympic park ?
Right , ah . It is so close to our home . How come we've never thought of that ?
The Olympic Park has a small forest . It is fit for picnic .
Very well , Go ahead .
Of course . What kind of postal savings account do you want to open ?
Hum .. Can you recommend me one with high interest ?
OK . We offer a few different kinds of postal saving services . They have different interest rates .
I want the one with the highest interest rate .
That would be our Savers Plus account . You must pay 10 000 yuan into your deposit account . In this way you can get 5 % dividend at the end of the year .
All right . I'II open this one .
Just fill out these forms , and I ' ll be with you in one second .
Thanks .
Ok , let ' s start opening some presents !
Oh look ! What a great little bib for the baby ! This will definitely come in handy ! Oh wow , you also got me a stroller ! That ' s so great ! Thank you !
This next one is from Betty .
A highchair and car seat ! Wow Betty , thank you so much ! I really appreciate it !
One more from Carla .
A playpen and crib ! Thanks Carla ! This is just what I needed !
OK , that ' s all of them . No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ?
Umm . I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital !
What happened to you ? You look like you got hit by a tornado !
I just got back from fighting the crowds .
You mean at the mall ? Was there a sale ?
Yeah . For five minutes , everything was half off . It was total chaos ...
Cool !
Grabbing , pushing and shoving ...
Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ?
Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
Yes , it will print immediately .
Sorry to hear that .
How about next week ?
Fine , we'll be expecting you then .
O . K . We offer a few different kinds .
I want the one with the highest interest rate .
That would be our Saver's Plus account .
4 . 5 % , that's good . How much money do I have to keep in it to get that rate ?
You have to maintain a balance of $ 10,000 in the account or the rate drops to 3 % .
All right . I ' ll open one of those .
Just fill out these forms , and I ' ll be with you in one second .
Thanks .
Absolutely . Here it is .
Could I try it on ?
Please do , the fitting-room is over there .
It feels a little tight around the waist . Do you have a bigger one ?
I'm sorry . We don't have this color in your size . We have some green ones in your size . Would you please have a look at this green one ?
OK . How much does it cost ?
It's 486 yuan .
There's a taxi rank over there , right outside the gate .
I'm sorry , he's out at the moment .
When do you expect him back ?
I think he'll be back in about an hour at least .
Well , may I leave a message ?
Yes , of course .
Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ?
Ok . Does he know your number ?
I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 .
13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on .
Good morning .
Would you like something to drink ?
No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk .
So , you're a serious coffee drinker .
Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted .
Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing . Everyone has to have something . For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ?
No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker .
Well , what would you like to talk to me about ?
I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .
I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it .
It is about the staff meetings . You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday .
Yes .
Well , I have been thinking about it . And I believe we could do things more efficiently here .
What do you suggest ?
The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week . We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation .
You mean because people have to go across town to get here .
Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road .
That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them .
I think they are important too . That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them .
I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that .
Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more .
Well .
I also think the meetings should be more focused . And I would be willing to take responsibility for that .
You mean you want to run the meetings ?
No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting . This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .
Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks .
I really think it would work . The meetings could be longer , and better organized .
I am not against the idea , Arnold . It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do . Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works .
Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it .
I will call the managers . Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this " new style . "
Can you show me some traditional Chinese arts and crafts ?
Maybe sandalwood fan is good .
Would you show me some ?
Of course .
They really smell fragrant . How much is a real sandalwood fan ?
The small ones are one hundred yuan for each . And the big ones are two hundred and thirty yuan .
I'll take two small ones and a big one .
What else are you interested in ?
I'm afraid not .
OK . Here you are .
OK . Is it in the box ? May I see it ?
Yes . This is the computer and this is the keyboard and the monitor .
Is there anything else ?
There are a mouse and a camera .
Is that all ?
Yes . How much is it to send these things to Shanghai by regular delivery ?
It depends on the weight of these things . Generally speaking , we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram .
I see . Can you weigh them for me , please ?
Please go over there to weigh them .
OK . See you later .
Yes . That is why I'm here .
Tell me your argument .
I was pulled over for allegedly speeding .
Are you sure you weren't speeding ?
To be honest , I really wasn't .
What speed were you going ?
I was under the speed limit . I was going 35 , when the speed limit was 40 .
I'm just going to let you go , since the arresting officer isn't here .
What about my ticket ? Do I still need to pay ?
Don't worry about it .
I'm so glad for your help .
Next week , it ' s going to be quite a shock for him !
He ' ll get used to it . They always do . I still remember when my daughter started . Are you going with him on his first day ?
You bet . I wouldn ' t miss it !
That ' s all right . Everyone feels under the weather sometimes . Just finish the rest when you feel well .
What ' s wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ?
Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ?
Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out .
Where will you go , sir ?
Friendship Hotel .
OK , it's not far from here .
I have something important to do , can you fast the speed ?
Sure , I'll try my best . Here we are .
How much should I pay you ?
The reading on the meter is 15 yuan .
Here's 20 yuan , keep the change .
Thank you very much .
while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement .
why not ?
the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing !
it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking .
I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children .
I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking .
all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty .
perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow .
I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them .
that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad .
you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking .
Not yet . But do you have any experience as an assistant ?
Yes . I have a lot of experience in that . I have worked for the sales company as an assistant since finishing my university .
OK . It sounds fine .
Susan , I'm sorry . Did you look up those files I requested ?
Yes , but I still can not find it . Maybe it is in this cabinet .
I couldn't find the files you request , even though I checked all the cross-references . I don't think it's there .
I am sure that document was filed .
Well , let me check again under a different heading .
Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files .
Maybe that's why I couldn't find it . All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V ' .
The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street .
How long will it take me to get there ?
It's about a ten-minute walk .
That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .
Not at all .
Yes . My wife and I are interested in renting a house for the summer .
Do you want a furnished house or an unfurnished one ?
Furnished .
Very well . How long do you want the house ? All summer ?
No , not all summer . Just for six weeks .
I'm afraid I can only rent it for two months .
My holiday is only six weeks , but I think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks . Is the house in good condition ?
Yes , it is . It was just painted and it has all the modern conveniences .
You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard .
You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ' t sleep well . What ' s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation .
Hope it all goes well . We're very busy at the moment and certainly don't want any problems at this time of year .
Yes , I realise that . We've spent a long time planning and preparing for the change-over . I'm confident we won't have any major problems .
Well , it'll take three weeks to demolish the old building and clear away the debris . We should be ready to start the construction work in week 23 .
How long will the sub contractors be on site ?
About ten weeks in total if everything goes according to plan .
I'm sure it will . So , we should be able to start moving the machinery in during week 34 . I'll confirm that date with our suppliers .
I think I can work well under pressure , if necessary .
How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ?
I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way .
You seem to be a kind-hearted lady .
Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature .
Please tell me your weaknesses if you can .
I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection .
That's OK . As long as you clean it up .
If I couldn ' t wait , could the prescription be mailed to me ?
Yes , you can have it delivered or filled at any location in our HMO .
When should I take this medication ?
You need to take it at bedtime .
Should I take this medicine on an empty stomach ?
Don ' t mix alcohol with this medication , but you can take it with or without food .
What are the side effects of this medication ?
You might feel a little dizzy at first , but it should pass .
Why ?
Well , my car won't start . I don't know what's the matter with it .
Could it be the battery ?
No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago . It must be other problems .
Well , I suppose it could be the gas .
No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday .
Perhaps it's the starter then ?
Yes , that's possible .
Let's go out for brunch .
Brunch ?
It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also .
Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch .
First of all , I need you to do the drying up . I ' m almost finished the washing up . I ' m going to clean the cooker when I finish .
Ok . I ' ll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them . Where is the tea towel ? Oh , here it is .
We ' ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it .
While you ' re cleaning the cooker , I ' ll wipe the worktop . That was a great meat , by the way .
Actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it .
My pleasure ! This tea towel ' s a little ragged . Do you have another one ?
Yes . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out .
Keep it and use it as rag . You can clean your bicycle with it .
Certainly sir . May I have your room key , please ?
Sure . Here you are .
Just a moment , please . I'll draw up your bill for you ... Thank you for waiting , sir . Your bill totals two thousand six hundred and fifty-eight yuan , including the phone and laundry .
That much ! Would you mind letting me have a look at it ?
Not at all , sir . Here you are .
Thanks . Well , It seems to be right . How much is that in dollars , please ?
Just a moment , sir . I'll calculate that for you . It comes to 305 dollars and 52 cents at today's exchange rate .
I see . OK .
How would you like to make the payment ?
In cash , please . Here you are .
Thank you , sir ... Here is your change . Could you check it , please ? Thank you for choosing our hotel . I hope you enjoyed your stay .
By the way , please forward my mail to this address .
Certainly , sir . We hope you have a good trip .
How do you plan to accomplish this ?
By doing everything necessary and for further study .
How long would you like to stay with this company ?
How long I will stay with the company depends on whether the company and I are satisfied with each other .
What do you think of this industry's outlook in five years ?
I do believe this industry will be developed rapidly in 5 years time .
Does it hurt when I push here ?
It ' s mostly on my right side . Right here !
Have you been feeling this way for awhile ?
I started feeling kind of sick last night after dinner , but this morning the pain got really bad !
Have you eaten anything unusual lately ?
No , not that I remember .
We are going to take you to an emergency room right now .
I will feel better when I know what the problem is . Thank you for the drugs .
I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP !
OK , I can have it ready by the end of the week .
No , you don ' t understand , I need this tomorrow morning ! I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ' s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! She ' s gonna kill me !
OK , I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon , but this suit is also very stained . I can ' t guarantee we can remove it completely .
Fine ! Can you also iron and starch this shirt ?
Certainly .
Great ! This is our secret ! If you see my wife , say nothing to her about this !
Very good , sir . What kind would you like ?
Could you tell me how many kinds there are in your bank ?
Besides the checking account , there's a monthly savings account and a daily interest account .
Oh , I think I'd like to take the monthly savings account then .
Would you fill out this form ?
OK . Here you are .
All right . And here's your deposit book .
Thank you . Goodbye .
Goodbye .
Let's buy some tickets .
The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train
Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ?
No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them .
All right . Have a seat , please . Let me ask you a few questions . First of all , may I have your name , please ?
My name's Donald Eakins .
How do you spell your last name , Mr . Eakins .
It's E-A-K-I-N-S .
E-A-K-I-N-S . First name , Donald . And what's your present address , Mr . Eakins ?
It's 1446 Pine Street .
1446 Pine . That's in San Francisco , isn't it ?
Yes , it is .
Student visa .
What is the reason for extension ?
I'll go into a practical training as soon as I receive my Master ' s degree from the University of Pennsylvania early next month .
We ' ll need a letter from your university and a financial statement from you .
What's Condiments ?
That's where you'll find things like salt and pepper .
Oh , I see .
Let's go to aisle 4 to pick up some pasta for tonight .
Great ! Pasta for dinner .
And let's get a loaf of bread at the bakery for breakfast .
Maybe we should get a shopping cart .
I'll put the shopping basket back .
Le'Ban is the new kid on the block , it's amazing they've had such tremendous success so soon ... With them on the scene , the competition is outthrough .
here's information about our competitor's recent market activities ...
Thanks , this will be a big help in putting together next quarter's marketing strategies . With competition this intense , we'll have to step up production even more . We need a price we can compete with .
We're in a very competitive environment . It's sink or saimin this market .
Better start swimming ! we've got to find a way to outsmart the other guys . I want a preliminarily strategic marketing plan on my desk by next Tuesday ... the competition never sleeps and neither should we .
Certainly , Mr . Alexander . When would Mr . Phillips like to leave ?
Let me check ... His flight ' s at 2:30 p . m . , so he should leave no later than 12 noon .
Can you supply us right away ?
Yes , we have plenty on hand right now .
Good , we'll take 500 suits .
OK , thanks for the order .
I am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager .
I am sorry . They are not available now .
Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago .
Of course I remember you .
I think I lost my wallet here .
Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything .
Really ? You didn't find a wallet ?
No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ?
Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor . Has anyone sat at this table since we left ?
No . It's been empty the whole time .
Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened .
I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill . You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ?
No . My friend did .
Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ?
No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down . It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table .
Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home .
I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house . But what should I do ?
Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home . Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that .
Should I call the police ?
You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets .
Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home .
I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir .
Thanks for your help .
How soon do you want it ?
Could you deliver it tomorrow ?
No problem .
Please handle the items carefully .
Certainly .
We will pay by collect on delivery .
It isn't gratitude . It's fear . Vince is afraid I'll jump to a competitor .
You wouldn't do that . Would you ?
I might . Vince knows he needs to keep me happy .
What about your accounts ?
I must've missed it .
Is this your first time flying ?
Yes . I'm going to San Francisco .
Oh , it's a beautiful city . I think you'll like it .
Hey , I'm feeling much better already .
Sometimes if you don't think about it , that sick feeling will go away on its own .
Thanks . By the way , my name is Mary .
I'm Frank . Nice to meet you .
On the left of the elevator of the 3rd floor .
I ' d like to buy a woolen vest for my grandpa .
I ' m sure you can find your favorite there .
Thank you very much .
It ' s my honor .
Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired .
Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies .
Oh , we always go to the movies . Can't we do something different ?
Well , do you have any suggestions ?
Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ?
It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things .
Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
OK .
Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ?
Practice makes perfect . By the way , what do you learn from your job ?
At first I didn't know anything about the machine . Now I know how to operate it . Besides , the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement .
Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance .
Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job .
I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work .
OK , let's go .
Thank you for waiting . It takes another ten to fifteen minutes , I'm afraid .
We have an appointment in half an hour .
I see .
Do you have anything else I can have instead ?
Well , yes . How about beef stew ? We can serve you at once .
I'll take beef stew , then .
How long will it take me to get there ?
It's about a ten-minute walk .
That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .
Not at all .
You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you .
You mustn't pick it in this place .
Where it is ?
It's a private garden .
Well , that's too far . Can you change some money for me ?
Surely , of course . What kind of currency have you got ?
RIB .
How much would you like to change ?
1000 Yuan . Here you are .
I'm going to prescribe some antibiotics and some cream to ease the itching and burning .
Ok , thank you ! Where should I buy them ?
The pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic .
Great ! What floor is pharmacy on ?
The fourth . I'll send the prescription down there so you can just pick it up on your way out .
Thank you !
Anything subject to duty in your suitcase ?
No , sir . Nothing except my personal belongings , such as clothes , notebooks and some gifts .
Any cigarettes or liquor ?
I have cigarettes for my own use .
I think you'll have to pay some duty on these cigarettes because they exceed the quota . And this article is liable for duty .
How much duty should I pay ?
One hundred dollars .
Here is the money .
Just a moment . I'll make out your duty memo . ( Writing and giving the memo to Mr . Green ) Take it and pay the girl over there .
Thank you .
You ' re in luck ! We ' re just a two-minute drive from there . Would you like to make a reservation ?
Not just yet . I have one or two questions . How much for a single ?
During the peak season , a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night . But we ' Ve got a Single Super Saver Special going on right now -- only $ 30 a night . And we ' Ve also extended our checkout time 00 in
That ' s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients .
Yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . We can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . Of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking
That sounds great . Do you accept checks ?
I ' m sorry , sir , we don ' t . But we do accept all major credit cards .
Do you mind I have a look at your computer ?
Of course not , I appreciate that .
Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity .
I see . What can I do now ?
You can send a compressed one .
And would you like an appetizer before your meal ? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup .
I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad .
Can I get you anything to drink ?
Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea .
Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
Thank you .
What are you doing in Australia ?
I'm attending a conference in Sydney this week . Remember ?
Oh , right . What time is it there ?
It's 10:00 P . M . And it's four o'clock in Los Angeles , right ?
Yes - four o'clock in the morning .
4:00 A . M . ? I'm really sorry .
That's OK . I'm awake now .
There are just too many people , and too many cars .
I wonder if there was an accident .
No , they just said it too many people were trying to get off at the Capitol exits .
Well , let ' s put on some music . We ' re going to be stuck in this for a while .
All right , what do you want to listen to ?
How about some Beatles ?
Yeah , all right .
You ' re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later .
This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ?
The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ' t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do .
Of course , you have . You must try harder this time .
And must I go back to school ?
No , you needn ' t do that . You ' d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes .
But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ' m nearly 17 .
You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ' t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study .
What else I ' Ve got to do ? Join the army ?
Who knows ! That might come to later .
O . K . Ticket , please .
Here you are .
Would you like a window or an aisle seat , Mr . Smith ?
I want an aisle seat as close to the exit door as possible , please .
Very well . Do you have any bags to check ?
No , I just have this one small bag .
Here you are , seat 12c . Please go to gate 23 after passing through the security checkpoint .
Thank you .
Have a nice day .
You , too .
OK . It ' s delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh .
( After they enter the park ) Oh , it's so quiet here . We have the park to ourselves , only you and me !
Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your left .
Oh , I see them . Some are doing Taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the Chinese Wushu .
A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China .
OK . What kind of room do you want ? We have single rooms , twin rooms , double rooms and suites available on Friday .
I want a single room with ocean view . Do you have one ?
Let me check . Yes .
OK . I will take it .
When do you check in ? How long are you planning to stay ? Do you have any special requirements ?
I guess I am going to arrive at 9:00 in the morning and I would like to leave at 200 in the afternoon on Sunday . Please give me a room away from the elevator . I hate noises while I am sleeping .
OK . No problem .
Can I have your keys , please ? Thank you . Here's your statement .
Excuse me . What are these charges ?
Oh , these are the phone charges and these are for something from the bar .
Wait a minute . I made a phone call , but I never made a connection .
I know , sir . Those aren't telephone company charges . Those are hotel charges .
Isn't that a bit excessive ?
I'm sorry , sir . It's our policy .
OK . Here is the money .
Thank you . Welcome to our hotel again .
What time is it now ?
It's already 3 8 o'clock .
Well , honey , wake up , or you'll be late for school .
I'd like to meet him . Will you introduce him to me ?
OK .
Is there a bathroom ?
No , but there is one downstairs , which my daughter used some years ago .
It sounds good . Could I go and see it myself ?
Certainly , you're welcome anytime .
See you later !
( after a while ) Good afternoon , Mrs . Smith . I called you just now .
Welcome ! Come in , please !
Yes .
This way please . Your room is upstairs ... Here it is .
Wonderful ! A modest , comfortable room . Ah , a beautiful window , through which I can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . How nice !
Yes , if you want to wash something , there is a separate lavatory room outside .
Excellent ! I like it ! When can I move in ?
Anytime you like .
OK .
I want to pick up my parcels .
Please show me your parcel order .
OK . Here you are .
Let me check your parcel number . Song Ping's parcel number should be CP 06230221 5 CN . Here is your parcel .
Thank you .
Not at all .
He has had a fever for one day . Just now at home , he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up . We were at a loss what to do . We called an ambulance and brought the baby here .
How long did the convulsion last ?
About 3 minutes .
Does he have any other complaints ?
Three days ago , he began to cough , sneeze and have a running nose . Yesterday , he began to have a fever .
Have you taken his temperature ?
It was 38 ° C this morning and it was 39 ° C just now .
Let me examine him to see if there is any rash . No rash .
Is it serious ? Is it meningitis ?
No , it is not meningitis . Just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection .
Does he have to be admitted to hospital ?
No . No need for admission . I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . Then I will give you a prescription . The pink tablets are used for his fever . When his temperature is over 38 ° C , give him one tablet . The other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions . The white liquid is for the cold . Give the baby plenty of water to drink .
Thank you very much , doctor .
I was hoping you'd have something on sale today .
We have nothing on sale today . But we're having a big sale next weekend .
Is the sale going to include dresses ?
Everything you can see will be on sale .
I like the sound of that . I'll just come back next weekend .
The savings will be worth the short wait . See you next weekend .
I tell you what , 800 is no good for me , but why don ' t you guys get started and I ' ll come by at around 8
That ' s fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ?
I thought he usually wrote horror books .
He does . He ' s good at this genre too . It ' s a captivating read .
We ' re going to the bookshop . Would you like to join us ?
Yes , I would . I need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , I love browsing through the latest paperbacks .
Me too . I need something to read on the flight to New York . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ' s books for her daughter .
I want to look at nelson Mandela ' s autobiography .
This is sure to be a worthwhile read .
Are the prices on the list firm offers ?
Yes . All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation .
I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices .
All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ?
How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan .
I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days .
You ' Ve got a fever and playing football isn ' t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ' s that on your arm ?
I don ' t know . It was there when I woke up this morning .
It ' s rash . I ' d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ?
I bashed it against the chair in my room .
Does it hurt ?
A little , but not much .
Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ' ll take you to the doctor ' s after breakfast .
If I ' m better this afternoon , can I go to school ?
If you are better , but I doubt you will be .
That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket .
Late night ?
Yeah , I got home around two .
A double room for the 12th ? The name is Wilson ?
Yes , that's right .
How long will you be staying ?
Three or four days , perhaps longer .
Very good , sir . We will be expecting you next Monday , the 12th .
you've got to see it . It's an unbelievable picture !
What's so interesting about it ?
Well , this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up , half his face had been bitten off !
What ? How did that happen ?
They think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face .
Wow . What does his look like now ?
It looks pretty frightening . He doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . Most of his nose and chin are missing too .
What did he look like before his dog bit his face off ?
He was actually quite handsome . What a shame .
What's he going to do now ?
It said that he's hoping to get a face transplant , but until then , he's looking forward to Halloween so he isn't the only one wearing a mask .
Certainly , may I take your name ? I ' ll let her know you ' Ve arrived .
Sure , it ' s Josh O ' Neil .
Ms . Stevens will be with you momentarily . Can I offer you something to drink ?
Yes , a coffee would be nice , thank you .
Here you are . Ms . Stevens is ready for you now . I ' ll show you to her office , right this way .
What seems to be the problem ?
I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it .
Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ?
No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it !
You said you received your card this morning , am I right ?
Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ?
Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons .
Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me .
I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . I went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains .
How did you spend the night there ?
We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful .
I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country .
Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't ?
Yes . It is one of the Five Mountains .
I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ?
I'd love to .
I have my Tennis Club card . Is that good enough ?
I ' m afraid not . It has to be a passport or a valid driver ' s license .
Oh ... wait a minute ... here ' s my driver ' s license .
OK , just fill in this application . You can sit over there . This brochure explains our services . We have free checking , and you will be given a debit card and on ATM card . There is no service
OK , I ' ll fill out the form and come right back .
It is . Hurry up ! You ' ll be late for school .
What ' s the time ?
It ' s nearly half past seven .
My watch says ten past .
It ' s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight .
Are you sure half past seven ?
Positive . I ' ll put the radio on .
It ' s only seven o ' clock . Your watch is fast .
No , it isn ' t . It ' s stopped . I forgot to wind it up last night .
I could have stayed in bed for another half hour .
I never heard of a swim station . Is that like a train or bus station ?
It's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against .
Holy cow ! I never heard of such a thing . How much do they cost ?
As a guest , sir , you pay nothing .
This sounds better every second . Now , when can I use the stations ?
If you want to swim , you can visit the gym any day between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m .
Oh , boy ! This is going to be great . I'm going to the gym right now !
I'm sure you'll enjoy your workout , sir . Everyone seems to like the swim stations .
What other things do I need to know ?
You'd spend 30 % of your time on the computer . You may be bored with a job like that .
No problem . I am used to it .
Yes . There are about fifty names on our approved supplier list , but for raw materials we tend to deal with three local companies .
From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ' s overbooked .
I know what overbooked is , I just don ' t understand how that could happen ?
Actually it ' s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ' t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats ,
So who has to stay behind ?
Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone .
Ok . I ' ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket !
Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ?
Why not ? I'd love to do that .
Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art .
Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ?
Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ?
I surely do . They must have had advanced machine in ancient China to do that .
No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .
Unbelievable ! I could never do that .
Of course , you can . Please put your articles in this bag and seal it .
OK .
Thank you . Here is your tag .
Would you tell me the rate per day for depositing my bag ?
Sure , madam . Only one dollar .
When does the cloakroom close ?
This cloakroom is open until 10 p . m .
Oh , dear ! I won't be back until about 11:30 tonight . Where can I pick up my bag ?
We will transfer your bag to the Lobby Floor Cloakroom . You may collect it there , madam .
I see . Thanks a lot .
You're welcome .
Will you be free this afternoon , say from 3 to 4 ?
Now let me check my schedule ... OK , you could to my office then .
2,000 AD $ .
Which would you like to remit , by mail or by cable ?
What is the difference between them ?
The cable will take less time for your account , in the meantime , the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one .
Well , I think the cable is better .
OK , please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary , your name and telephone .
All right . Here you are .
Everything is OK . The commission is 50 yuan .
Here you are . Thanks a lot .
Yes , I want it to made of tweed .
Fine . And the charge is $ 100 .
When will it be available ?
Next Wednesday .
I ' m sorry I kept you waiting so long . I'm running a little late today .
No problem . That happens to all of us , it goes badly with the traffic .
Thank you . Can I offer you some refreshment ?
Why not , thank you . A little tea would be nice .
Yeah here you go . Actually I also want to return this keyboard .
Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ?
The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear .
I see , and what about the keyboard ?
I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work .
I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages .
Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways .
Don ' t say that . It owes to your efforts and team spirit .
Oh , it was nothing . Anyone could have done it . I still have a lot to learn yet .
You are very modest . Best luck in your new position .
Thank you . I won ' t let this promotion change me .
For today ?
No , early saturday morning .
We have a flight that we'll put you there at ten AM . Is that ok ?
Nothing earlier ? I prefer flight at nine thirty .
I'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight .
No , exactly not
How about afternoon ?
Sounds not good . I won't take it .
How did you do it ?
I am on a diet . And I do more exercise regularly .
What's the secret then ?
It lies in perseverance .
Well . It's hard for me . I can't keep doing exercise .
You should have a try .
Why are they all in glass boxes ?
For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .
So there isn't air in the glass boxes ?
No , there isn't . They are all vacuumed .
I wonder how old these things are , thousands of years ?
Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time .
Hey , look at the three-leg cup . I've seen it on TV .
The bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless !
Yeah , it has no value at all . Who will use this cup today ?
Danny , priceless means so valuable that you can't put a price on it .
Oh , it does ?
Did you get any honors or awards at your university ?
No . It ' s a pity about it .
Were you involved in any club activities at your university ?
Yes . I was a member of the basketball Society . I like playing basketball .
What extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ?
I sometimes played basketball and sometimes played football .
What ' s the result ?
We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received .
That seems very impressive . Good work !
Thank you , but I cannot take all the credit . Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level .
I see .
Have you used any hotel services this morning or had breakfast at the hotel dining room , Mr . Green ?
Yes , my friend and I just had breakfast at the dining room , but we didn't use any services .
How about the charge for the days you shared the room with your friend ?
Please add to my account .
The total for the eight days is five hundred sixty yuan .
OK . Here you are .
Schedule it for this afternoon , when Ken gets back .
I don ' t think he ' s back today .
Oh , that ' s right . Go ahead anyways . I ' ll fill him in . We can ' t lose this order under any circumstances !
I know , it ' s a big one .
But I am a transfer passenger . I have a connecting flight to Miami .
So you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area .
Yes . It ' s quite troublesome .
Why not go and find a porter ?
Hmm ... does he have a good ear for hip hop music ?
Well , I don't know , but we can find out . We can talk to him and ask if he wants to join our group .
Well , I am all ears . Maybe they are helpful .
Firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . And secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . The last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age .
I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it .
Good luck to us .
Yes . I ' m calling from Westwood and Westwood Attorneys . I need to make a reservation for Mr . Alex Brent .
Fine , madam . When will Mr . Brent be arriving , and how many nights will he be staying ?
Oh , I need a small one , otherwise my luggage will be overweight .
What about this one ?
Oh , this is fine .
Good night .
Will it take me long to get there ?
No . It's not far at all .
Thank you very much .
That's all right . Have a good day .
Well , I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month . It hasn ' t arrived yet .
Certainly , Ms . Ransom . Do you have an order number ?
I would like to talk to you about this year ' s election .
Is that right ?
I am a volunteer for this year ' s campaign .
That ' s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand .
I know history is about to be made , and I would like to be a part of it .
That ' s fantastic .
Are you planning on voting ?
I ' m going to vote .
Go to your polling place early on Election Day .
I will . Good luck with your volunteering .
I would like to help you with both .
That will work out fine . To make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ?
A dressy party would be fun !
That will work out fine . Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best ?
We should probably have both .
Yes , that will work out fine . Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ ?
Maybe we could do both !
Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details .
Nice ! Brunch !
Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?
Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
Looks good ! I ' ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ' t forget the syrup !
Oh , I see . I am Jack White , Personnel Manager . Take a seat , please .
Glad to meet you , Mr . White .
Miss Lu , have you got any experience in restaurant service ?
Yes . Since I entered college , I have been working at a fast food restaurant as a part-time waitress .
For how long ?
3 years .
Our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . Can you serve them in English ?
That's why I applied for this job . Now I am studying Hotel English in my college , and I am quite familiar with the western courtesy and restaurant etiquette . I am sure my public relation skills will leave a strong impression on your customers .
You must know our working hours are very long and overtime work is frequent .
I don't mind that .
I think I will give you a 3 months ' trial . The salary for this period is 800 yuan a month with no bonus . After that period if we both feel satisfied , a formal contract would be signed .
When am I supposed to start working ?
Next monday . Bring your resume and diploma with you .
Yes , I will . Thank you , Mr . White . Goodbye !
Goodbye !
I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ?
Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ' t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful .
How do you think if I volunteer for some work ?
I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives .
Great ! What time ?
I ' m free all afternoon . Why don ' t we meet at 1 o ' clock in the lobby ?
Yes , I enjoy working with that .
Great . We have a very pleasant working condition and I think we have a fine staff to work with .
Where does it go wrong ?
Let me stop my car for check . Oh , my god . I got a flat tyre .
Can it keep going ?
Sorry . You'd better get off for taking another taxi .
No wonder you brought such a big bag today .
I brought Strawberry Sticks . See ?
Those are the ones that are pre-dipped in sweet coating !
Yep . And there's real strawberry chunks in the coating .
It says that there will be a blackout from 5 p . m . to 7 p . m . in our neighborhood today .
Blackout ? Even the TV has the limit .
Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?
Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either !
That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ?
Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner !
OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here .
How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ?
Barbie ? You know , I might be seven , but I'm not a girl .
Do you have a better plan ?
All right , all right .
Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves .
Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
oh , that was just a quick bite to eat---that doesn't count !
ok , ok , how about we just go Dutch ? It's settled . Listen , I'm still pretty new around here , would it be alright if you found the restaurant ?
ok ... sure .
What's the answer ?
We decided that we could agree to your price , but we are a bit worried about the slow delivery .
Let me see . I quoted your delivery in three months , didn't I ?
Yes , but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible .
I thought you would be worried about it . So I rang Auckland last night . As you are our biggest customer , they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave Auckland next month .
Good , if you agree we'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then .
By all means .
Well , I'm going on to bed . I'm beat .
Okay . I'm going to stay up a while . I've got to go over the household budget . We're a little overspent this month .
Please tell Tim to close the door to the basement . I don't want the dog down there tonight .
Okay . Good night . See you at breakfast .
You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ?
Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I ' ll get it signed for you .
It's getting late , and you have to wake up early tomorrow .
There is no way that I can fall asleep right now .
Try listening to some soft music .
It won't work . I'm nowhere close to being tired .
I really don't care , just go to sleep .
What if I stay up and do something , until I get tired ?
You'll be up all night if I let you do that .
I'm going to get to sleep eventually .
You need to go to sleep now , so go to sleep .
Good night .
Are you having any luck ?
Not really . There aren't any used bookcases listed . But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday . I think I'll go to them .
Do you mind if I go with you ?
Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
I learned to negotiate from my mother . I thought I was pretty good at bargaining , but I had a problem the other day at Kimble's Department Store .
What happened ?
I wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . It was priced at forty dollars , so I started by offering the salesclerk thirty .
Of course we have lots of teas ?
What do you recommend ?
What about a green tea or perhaps a jasmine tea ?
What ' s this one ?
That ' s Oolong tea -- it ' s a Cantonese tea .
Ok , I ' ll try that .
Well , to be more specific , the free stuff , like soap , lotion , and shampoo .
I understand . Now , you're saying that you've already used up all your amenities ?
Oh , no ! I've got all I need for my stay here .
So , what's the problem ?
I need souvenirs !
You want some souvenirs !
Yes , yes . Souvenirs .
But , sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items .
That's not the same thing . If you buy hotel souvenirs , they have no sentimental value .
I understand , sir . I'll call housekeeping . You'll have your souvenirs shortly .
Oh , this way please . What size do you wear ?
Size 41 . I want something in dark flannel .
How about this one ?
It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I'd like it better . This seems too light for winter . Do you think you could get me one ?
All right . I'll show you something darker . Do you like this one ?
It looks good . But can I try it on ?
Of course . Let me help you .
Thanks . It's comfortable . Well , how much is it , please ?
$ 280 .
Ok . I'll take it . Here's the money .
You mean you can read and write both of them ?
No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French .
Can you read and write English well ?
I can speak the language better than read and write .
Do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of English-speaking countries ?
I think so . I used to be an interpreter .
Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work ?
The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm .
I'm really not sure .
You like my living room set , don't you ?
Where did you buy it ?
I found mine at IKEA .
Are they expensive ?
Everything I got from IKEA cost me a couple thousand .
Is the furniture crafted well ?
The furniture isn't built cheap .
I'll pay the money , as long as I'm getting what I pay for .
You will feel comfortable paying the money .
World Airlines , Flight 201 .
And your name , please ?
John Anderson .
Yes , sir . You're booked on Flight 201 , leaving in one hour .
Thank you .
What size are you looking for ?
Well , I ' m looking for size 10 but you don ' t have it .
How about this one ? I think it looks terrific on you .
Yes , I like the color . Can I try it on ?
Sure . The fitting room is on your right .
It fits well . I like it a lot . What do you think ?
You look pretty in red .
Oh , it ' s my favorite . How much is it ?
$ 29 . 99 .
Okay . I ' ll take it . Thank you very much for your help .
You ' re welcome .
Do you have a registration card ?
No , I don ' t . I ' m a tourist .
Then you need to register as a new patient . Can I have a look at you ID card ? I need your name , age , occupation , address and contacting number .
Here you are .
Thanks . Which kind of medicine do you prefer , western medicine or traditional Chinese medicine ?
I ' d like to try traditional Chinese medicine . I heard it really works quite well if you know what you're doing .
All right . Yes , he does . The registration fee is 7 yuan , please .
Excuse my troubling you . You purchased our products last year and now I am following up to find out about their workings . Are they still in good condition now ?
Yeah , exactly ! I bought them last year . En ... at present , they are still in good state .
That's it ! All of them have first-class quality and performance . Besides , we adopt advanced technology . Now we have developed new products . They are much better than what you have bought .
Your company is developing so fast . Maybe later on I will plan to buy more .
That's great ! Thanks for your support . If any , please remember to call us . I am afraid I have to say goodbye now ! Bye , Mr . James !
Bye !
Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ?
Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ?
There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table .
The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ?
You know , that is one of my favorites !
OK , I'll take one order of that .
You could choose another appetizer for half price to share .
Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings .
Well , I've just arrived in my room , but there are no instructions in English about the facilities available ! Could you help me for a moment ?
Of course not . What exactly would you like to know ?
First , what is the number for room service ?
It's 1200 . Room service is available 24 hours a day .
Very good . Now , could you help me to adjust the air conditioning , please ? It's too hot in my room .
Yes , the control unit is on the wall next to the bathroom . Is 24 ° C all right ?
Yes , that's perfect . Another thing , if need more items for the mini-bar , which Number should I call ?
You should call the Housekeeping Department on 2300 . They will replace any stock for you immediately .
I see . So , is it possible to make international phone calls from my room ?
That's no problem . Just dial 9 to get an outside line , and then dial the number as usual .
Well , thanks a lot for your help .
No problem , sir . If there's anything else you need , you can find me at the desk by the elevator , or you can call housekeeping if I'm not there .
OK , goodbye .
Goodbye , sir .
Let regive you a hand .
No , thank you . I can manage it , I think .
Are you interested in making this investment ?
We haven't decided yet , we will let you know if we do .
I ' m going to prescribe some antibiotics , and some cream to ease the itching and burning .
OK . Thank you . Where should I buy them ?
The pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic .
Great . What floor is the pharmacy on ?
The fourth . I ' ll send the prescription down there , so you can just pick it up on your way out .
Thank you .
Really ? Is there ' Wall Street Journal ' , please ?
There are several , take a piece . The crash appears in the headline . It is famous for offering catastrophe stories .
I have a long flight for ten hours . I need to choose a magazine .
There are various magazines in the rack .
Give me the latest issue of ' National Geographic ' .
That's the top magazine in America and is popular with young people . OK . It is totally 30 dollars .
Here you are .
Have a nice trip .
No , Mary went first last time .
Oh , Okay .
Have you had any type of cold lately ?
No , I haven ' t had a cold . I just have a heavy feeling in my chest when I try to breathe .
Do you have any allergies that you know of ?
No , I don ' t have any allergies that I know of .
Does this happen all the time or mostly when you are active ?
It happens a lot when I work out .
I am going to send you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma .
Thank you for your help , doctor .
Don't take that tone with me ! I saw you hit your brother .
No ! He hit me first .
I don't care . You know better than to hit him . Go sit on your bed for 10 minutes .
All right . What's your membership card , please ?
489 3362 1978 .
And your name ?
Eve .
What's the expiration date on your card ?
It's July 16,2009 .
Where is your car now ?
It's on the west street , near Royal Hotel .
And which direction were you going ?
I was going west .
What is the make and model of your car ?
BMW 530 .
What color is it ?
It's red .
What's your licence plate number ?
SAY 201 .
All right , Madam . I'll have a tow truck there within 30 minutes .
We'll be taking everything offline in about two hours ' time . It'll be down for a minimum of twelve hours . If everything goes according to plan , it should be up again by 6 pm on Saturday .
That's fine . We've allowed forty-eight hours to be on the safe side .
He ' d like to do it as soon as possible , sir . How about tomorrow at 2:45 ?
Mm , yeah , that ' ll be great . Tell him I ' ll see him then .
There're all spicy or hot of heard .
That ' s right . If you have hot dishes , you can try some .
It might be too hot for me .
And there are Cantonese cuisine and Kiangsu cuisine .. Most people like them .
What about any special Beijing dishes ?
There ' re Beijing roast duck .
OH , yes . I heard of a lot of about it . I like very much to try it . Where can I find it ?
You can find it in most restaurant . The best place certainly is Quanjude restaurant .
Is it near here ?
Not too near but not too far either . A taxi will take you there in fifteen minutes . the traffic is not too bad , I mean .
Well , thank you for your information . What ' s the name of that restaurant again ?
Let me write it down on a piece of paper for you . You can show to the taxi driver .
That ' s very kind of you . Thanks a lot .
May I ask what time he will come back ?
I think he will come back at 3 p . m . Do you want to call later ? Or would you like to leave a message for him ?
I'd like to leave a message . Please ask him to call me back as soon as he returns . I'm A and he has my number .
OK . I will do that .
Thank you very much . Bye .
You're welcome . Bye .
What about this dry red ? It's good indeed , it never goes to the head .
OK . Give me one , please .
Here it is .
Thank you .
I'm always at your service .
I'm mad ! I said now ! Turn off the TV , and do it now .
Mom , just ten more minutes . The show is going to be over soon .
Peter , if you don't do it soon , I will throw your toys in the trash can .
Not too bad .
So , what experience do you have ?
I have ten years marketing experience . This includes both entry level and management positions . In my last position , I worked my way up to being director of the marking department .
I can see that from your resume . Your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company , is that right ? Later , why did you decide to leave your former post ?
I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new .
I see . Do you want to work full-time or part-time ?
I would rather work full-time .
I'll make note of that . Now , what are your salary expectations ?
I am willing to negotiate , but I expect at least $ 40,000 a year .
Is there anything else ?
Give me one coke , please .
Is this to go or to eat here ?
To go , please .
That comes to four dollars and ten cents .
And can I have some ketchup , please ?
It's on the service counter over there . Please go to help yourself .
Really ? Let me have a look at it . Mm . OK . Let me change it for another one .
Thank you very much .
What kind of account would you like to open ?
I need another savings account .
Do you have another account with us ?
I sure do .
Would you like to transfer money from that account into your new one ?
That ' s fine .
How much would you like to transfer ?
Transfer $ 100 .
Give me a moment while I complete your transaction .
That ' s fine . Thank you .
Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today ?
Yes , the officer is here today .
What's your case ?
I was pulled over for running a red light , but I never did .
Do you believe that the officer lied ?
There was a camera on the signal . So , he was obviously lying .
Your license plate was caught on camera ?
A picture of my license plate was never taken .
Since there is no picture of your license plate on record , I'm going to let you go .
Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me .
Look . Two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . That's why that car stops .
More and more people easily get irritated while driving .
Yes . This is what is called road rage .
What store did you get it from ?
I went to Macy's and picked it out .
I love your outfit right now .
Well , I think you look nice today too .
Thanks . I found these new shoes earlier at the store .
I think that those are some really nice shoes . What kind are they ?
These are Chucks .
Your shoes look really nice . How much did you get them for ?
They only cost me about forty dollars .
I'm going to go get a pair for myself .
Please , George .
All right . Just wait a minute , OK ?
Here you are .
Which flight do you want to change ?
The next one to my destination . I have to be there as soon as possible .
Did you have the room checked before we move in ?
Which room are you in ?
1808 . The toilet doesn ' t work properly ; the water doesn ' t run in the shower .
I ' m awfully sorry to hear that . I ' ll turn to it right away .
oh . no as a matter of fact , i haven't danced for a long time .
but i can see you dance wonderfully well .
thanks for flattering me .  i think you dance much right ?
no , just occasionally
oh , i like this music very much , let's tango .
i'm afraid i can't dance well .
Oh , sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual . I will look into the matter .
This is very annoying .
I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course .
No , I don't risk it .
How about a delicious dessert then , with our compliment ?
I'm not keen on dessert as a habit . They are fattening .
I see , sir . I'm sure everything will be right next time you come .
My name is Jerry and we are on the intersection of West Road and East Road .
Sir , leave the house if the fire draws any closer to your house . Our men will be over in 5 minutes .
You'd get plenty of sleep for you work so hard .
I always drink too much wine in the evening .
You shan't drink more wine in the evening .
Yes , you are right .
And you'd take some exercise every day .
Many thanks for your advice .
I just got back from fighting the crowds .
You mean at the mall ? Was there a sale ?
Yeah . For five minutes , everything was half off . It was total chaos ...
Cool !
Grabbing , pushing and shoving ...
It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances .
Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ?
Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate .
I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ?
Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu .
Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today .
Sure . But the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it !
Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon , too . You ' Ve been doing some great work !
I have never been to the personnel market .
Really ? I have been there several times .
Are there many employers ?
Yes . The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers .
So there will be many large companies in the personnel market , right ?
Yes , there are many famous corporations .
When will there be a job fair ?
Every Saturday and Sunday
Do I need to pay to go into the personnel market ?
No , it's free .
How about going there to have a look now ?
OK , let's go .
What is the direct impact of the terrorist attack upon your country's economy ?
Once the US economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack , the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world .
What challenges is your country's economy facing at the moment ?
We do face a lot of challenges because there is still much uncertainty about the world economy . It's very important for us to strike a proper balance between investment in fixed assets and household consumption .
Among all the assistants , I think you're on top of it . Based on the annual evaluation , the board of directors decided to give you a bonus .
Really ? I am too happy .
I've been reviewing your work over the past few months . Thanks to your excellent work , we benefit much from your project . And you should get the perfect attendance award too .
Thanks for your trust . Owing to my colleagues ' help , I've successfully completed my task .
You are very modest and diligent . The distribution of bonus derived from the performance evaluation . You deserve it .
Thank you very much . I will redouble my efforts in the future .
Just dial 0 , wait for the dial tone , and then dial the phone number you want to call . Or we can place a call for you , if you want .
No , thanks a lot . I'll try it myself .
At school , we sometimes have Chinese food for lunch .
That's good . We eat Chinese food only at the Chinese restaurant .
My mother can make some Chinese food .
Really ? That's wonderful !
Did you buy tickets already ?
No . Do we need tickets ?
Well , probably . Probably you will have to wait in line if you don't have tickets .
Outside or inside ?
Outside , on the sidewalk .
Hmm . It's very cold today . But I brought my jacket . Maybe it will be alright to wait .
The MYOMA is very popular . There will be a lot of people .
MYOMA ? What's that ?
Oh , sorry . It stands for the Museum of Modern Art . It's an acronym . M O M A MYOMA .
I see . Do you have any suggestions for other things we should do ?
I suggest you go to the Jewish Museum . It ' s not far from the Guggenheim , near Central Park . It is really very interesting . Also , there is a great museum of medieval European art further up north . It ' s called the Cloisters .
How can we get up there ?
You can take a bus .
But Larry says the neighborhoods in the north are dangerous .
Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .
Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area .
I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
How much do you think the rent will be ?
I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
Thanks you . Shall we stand a bit further ? I would like to take the tower in .
No problem .
That's OK . If you want the photo I will mail it to you .
No need , sir .
Well , the 4 x 6 is fine .
Which do you prefer , color or black and white ?
The last one is black and white , all the rest should need color .
OK .
I hope they will come out well . When should I pick them up ?
They will be ready at noon tomorrow . Each negative develops one print , right ?
Yes , it is . And develop them as glossy as possible .
No problem . Do you need another film ?
Yes , a roll of Kodak film please .
It is totally $ 20 including the deposit for films .
I'll put the call through then .
Thank you .
on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health .
I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse
what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?
it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .
I see , so it's similar to global warming ?
they're related to one another , yes .
I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .
people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .
people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .
I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place .
I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house .
We need to find a good realtor .
Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .
What do you mean ?
Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .
But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .
Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .
I still think we should have a realtor . We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has
Of course we need a home inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .
So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?
It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .
And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?
Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .
Why ?
Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .
Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .
It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .
I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .
Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store .
Can you tell me the concept of e-commerce ? Now , many people mentioned the word , ' e-commerce ' , in front of me .
E-commerce , or Electronic Commerce is the practice of purchasing and selling products or services over the Internet .
What kinds of channels can you use in e-commerce ?
We can complete a trade by email , electronic data interchange and smart cards , and so on .
What are the benefits of e-commerce ?
Firstly , it can overcome the geographic limitation . And secondly , e-commerce can lower the internal costs . And thirdly , people like us , can also open stores on Internet .
How things have changed now !
I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !
I told you we should have stayed in town today . The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow . Why did you want to come up here ?
I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .
Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?
I don't know .
I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .
What do you mean ?
We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time . We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .
I have plenty of gas .
Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working . We can't just let the car run and run . If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .
So what can we do ?
Turn the lights off . Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . That will conserve the heat as long as possible .
Alright . That's a good idea .
I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .
Days ?
Yes , it happens . That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .
Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .
Probably we'll survive . But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .
How much do you want us to pay you ?
I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 150,000 a year . To be honest , I left the company to get more income .
Do you know of any banks near here ?
You'll see one at the corner on your right .
Come on ! I'll pay you back on Tuesday .
Last time I lent you money , you never paid me back .
I promise if you lend me five dollars today , I will repay you in full next week .
Ok , but I'm taking your skateboard as collateral .
Fine ! I can't believe you don't trust me .
It's nothing personal , just business .
By the way , the meeting will be held in your office .
OK , thank you very much .
Not at all . That's what I should do .
Were you looking at a particular refrigerator ?
I like that Kenmore refrigerator .
This particular refrigerator is a very good choice .
Tell me about it .
Not only is it affordable , but it comes with all the appliances .
What are the appliances .
It has an ice maker , water dispenser , and plenty of room on the inside .
I'd like to see it for myself .
Go right ahead .
I like what I see .
Oh , here comes a bus !
It comes on the dot .
Yes . Sometimes I can notice a constriction in the chest and shortness of breath after a fit of sneezing . And I often suffer from a running nose with a profuse watery discharge .
Does it occur seasonally or all year round ?
It has been seasonal during these past three years .
Are you sensitive to other things ?
Yes , things like seafood and penicillin-type drugs .
OK . Let me examine your nose . According to your case history and the examination , I believe that it's allergic rhinitis .
What useful treatment can you offer ?
I'll give you a series of specific skin tests . Then we'll know exactly what substances you're allergic to . Then I'll give you some causes of desensitization therapy .
Have you got the time , Tom ?
Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch !
But you bought it only last month .
Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired .
How long will it take us to get there ?
I think about ten minutes by bus .
It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain .
Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus .
When do you expect him back ?
I think he'll be back in about an hour at least .
Well , may I leave a message ?
Yes , of course .
Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ?
Ok . Does he know your number ?
I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 .
13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on .
Dick ? How come ? He used to be as meek as a lamb .
Yes , he used to be . But now he ' s drifting off track .
He must have been in bad company , or he wouldn ' t be off the beans .
But he always wimps out of difficulty .
Don't worry , he'll make good progress step by step .
Two thousand should get me through the year .
Here's a form to get you started .
My old card is perfect , so all I want you to do is copy it exactly .
I think you'll be very pleased with how well we duplicate your old card .
... Here you go
Thanks . Come back here next Wednesday to pick up your order , please .
I'm sorry , but can you give me a three-day turnaround ?
If you don't mind paying a little extra , it's absolutely no problem .
What did you say ?
I told him that I hadn ' t got a raise for three years . I also told him that one of my best co-workers quitted her job because she had not been promoted for eight years .
Did he want to know the reasons ?
Yes . I told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession . But I thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only .
That ' s sex discrimination . When will you get the reply ?
In a couple of days , I was told .
Wish you good luck !
Thank you .
What brings you here ?
I'm here on vacation .
Sorry to say , but nothing can be done . The equipment broke down and can't be fixed till Friday .
Oh , I hope it be fixed on Friday .
Yes , it is !
The total is 45 yuan .
45 yuan ? It is too much , Are you sure ?
It is 45 yuan on the meter .
Is there something wrong with your meter ?
No . I am sure about that .
OK . Could you give me a receipt ?
Yes . This is your receipt .
Yes , Mr . Reynolds . They were approved yesterday . You can pick up the check today .
Oh wow ! Thanks a million , Angie !
Oh , yes , my daughter bought it yesterday . We call her Lulu .
It looks so cute . Is it a parrot ?
Yes . Just look at her colorful feathers . What else can it be ?
I see . It's interesting that there is also a parrot in my English book . His mane is Polly .
Really ? A foreign parrot !
He can speak English , too .
Maybe you can teach Lulu some English words .
Lulu . Lulu . Say hello . hello . Oh , she is so smart . Good bird .
How can I help you ?
I need to see if we can get together today .
Don't worry . I will try to get a taxi for you . You can take it to the bus station .
I am very grateful to your help .
Don't mention it . It is my duty .
Thanks again .
So , I wish to apply for the sole agency of your product in our local market . If you give us the agency , that will be more substantial for our cooperation .
To be frank , you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country . I'd like to know some ideas of terms on which you would be willing to operate as our agent .
As we are a well-established company , we are very familiar with the customers ' needs . Besides , we can make full use of our good connections with the wholesalers and retailers here and develop a good market for your products if appointed as your agent .
Sounds reasonable . I will tell my boss about you agent application . Another question , what do you think is the minimum annual sales you can guarantee ?
To be on the safe side , and for garment of all materials , sizes , and styles , I think the amount will be 50,000 pieces a year .
Well . As our sole agency , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own .
No , certainly not .
When is a good time to catch him ?
In about twenty minutes .
Oh , it is the right time for you purchasing in our clothes shop . We are now having a low price on all our summer apparel .
Really ? What's that ?
Everything for summer is 20 % off .
I like this T-shirt . Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with it ?
Sure . We have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the T-shirt . Look at this section .
This one is good .
You have good taste . It is very much in style this year .
I'll take this one . How much are they ?
160 yuan .
Here you are .
What ? You haven ' t taken the bus before ?
No , I ' m afraid not .
Well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . Besides , you should let old people on first .
Sorry .
It ' s all right . Where are you going ?
I wanted to see the White House .
Oh , well you don ' t want this bus , anyway . It goes to Georgetown .
Oh , no .
It ' s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A .
Oh , well thank you very much .
You ' re welcome .
How long does it take ?
6 hours . If you are in a hurry we can develop it in 3 hours .
There is no need . I will come back tomorrow .
If you have any problem , please come to me .
I surely will . How much is this wood carving ?
You are an expert on it . That wood carving is very rare . But I'm so sorry . that is not for sell .
That's OK . Is anything else recommended ?
Do you have any special request ?
I'd like to see some traditional arts .
So that means you are shopping for presents ?
Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends .
Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle .
Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut .
I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best .
You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale .
As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country .
Wow , you are the expert on it .
Yes .
What kind of teaching certificate do you have ?
I have a TEFL certificate .
How many years of experience do you have ?
I have three years of teaching ESL and four years of teaching per-school children .
When did you get your TEFL certificate ?
I got my TEFL certificate three years ago .
Why do you want to teach at our school ?
Well , I ' Ve heard many good things about it . I also like teaching young children .
That ' s great . Can you speak Chinese ?
Yes , just a little .
Can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10:00 ?
I sure can .
Great . See you then .
It's me . The D-man ! I sat behind you in English . Are you and Taylor still dating ?
Um ... we never were . We're just friends .
Well , if you're not seeing anyone , maybe we could ...
... I am seeing someone . This is Yi-jun , my ...
Brian , may I have a pleasure to have a dance with you ?
Ok .
This is really wonderful party .
Yes , you are always popular with everyone . and you look very pretty today .
Thanks , that's very kind of you to say . I hope my necklace goes with my dress , and they both make me look good I feel .
You look great , you are absolutely glowing .
Thanks , this is a fine party . We should have a drink together to celebrate your birthday
All right .
Let's go under the tree .
No , we can't . It's thundering .
Then let's go to that store .
Thank you very much . By the way , is the hospital beside the bookshop .
Right , if you see the bookshop , you can see the hospital .
Thank you for your help .
Not at all .
Well , I think this one is a little too small . Would you please bring me a bigger one ?
I am sorry the larger ones are out of stock now . But you might be lucky at our Branch .
Would you like to try my special recipe ?
Wow , let me try . It tastes nice . How did you make it ?
It ' s as easy as pie . I always follow recipes .
Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ?
For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share .
Don't you think you would miss having other people around ?
No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy
If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ?
That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like
Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?
I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children !
About one week .
Where will you live during the vacation .
In the hotel .
Have you made a reservation ?
Yes , we have .

I see . When did it start ?
It started yesterday . I didn't eat any supper .
Have you got a temperature ?
I think so . I feel very hot .
Let's see . Yes . You ' Ve got quite a high temperature .
I've got an awful headache , too , and my throat hurts .
Hm ... I think you ' Ve got the flu .
Is it serious ?
No , not at all , but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine .
How often must I take it ?
Three times a day after meals .
Thank you , Doctor . Goodbye .

Do you often suffer from backache ?
No , I don't . I've never had a bad one before .
When did it start ?
About four days ago .
Well , go home and rest in bed for two days , then you'll feel better .
Can you give me some medicine ? It's very painful .
Yes , I'll give you some pills . Take one a time and three times a day , and come back in three days . If you don't feel ...
Hi . I understand that you have a house for sale , haven ' t you ?

See you tomorrow at seven . Make sure your dress a little formally . I heard the restaurant is kind of upscale .
Thank you , see you then .
See you .
I have it right here .
Great . Can I take it with me now ? Or do you need me to fill in some forms or something ?
No , you can take it away now . I just need you to sign here .
Here you are .
Just one thing before you go , could you please prepare your documents in accordance with the L / C within the validity period ?
No problem , I'll get on that right away . Thanks , bye .
I've come to make sure that your stay in Beijing is a pleasant one .
Thank you so much .
Let me know how it works .
I have to say , I have had enough of this roller coaster .
I know what you mean . I'm like a yo-yo .
Last week I was down to 60 kilos . This week I had one donut more . Now I'm up to 62 kilos .
I ' m sorry the restaurant is full now . You have to wait for about half an hour . Would you like to have a drink at the lounge until there ' s a table available .
No , thanks , I ' ll come back later . May I reserve a table for two ?
Yes , of course . May I have your name , sir ?
Bruce By the way , can we have a table by the window ?
we ' ll try to arrange it , but I can ' t guarantee sir .
That ' s fine .
your table's ready , sir ? Please step this way .
Shall we leave it to the brokers ?
Yes . They usually do it .
Do they charge for that ?
Of course . In Europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service .
Is it the same in America ?
They do the work without charge to the importer .
It's part of their service , isn't it ?
Exactly .
Is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ?
No , you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment .
I see . By the way , how do we prove the ownership of our goods ?
You must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice .
I see . Thank you .
You are welcome .
There are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop . For example , there is tricolored pottery originating in the Tang Dynasty , embroidery , batik , jade carving , just to name a few . Do you have anything in mind ?
No , not really . But I think it should be something distinctively Chinese . And easy to carry .
I would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik . They are very easy to carry .
So , we'd like to see some embroidery .
How long does it take to get there ?
About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ' d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive .
Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time !
Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers .
Great ! I ' ll take it .
Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train !
I understand . Thank you very much !
Have a great trip .
Is this amount correct ?
Yes , sir , it is .
Thank you , the service was good
Please come again .
Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air .
I know , I know . But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world !
Really ? What's the series about ?
Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it .
It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth .
I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results .
Really ? that's interesting !
Yeah . Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good .
OK , I'll give it a go .
Sure . Let me check his schedule . How about tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 ?
I ' m not available tomorrow afternoon . How about tomorrow morning ?
I ' m sorry . Dr . Galas is fully engaged tomorrow morning . How about the day after tomorrow at 9:30 in the morning ?
That ' s fine . Thanks .
You ' re welcome . Could I have your name and phone number , please ?
Certainly . My name is Janet Smith , and my phone number is 610-555-1234 .
Very good , Ms . Smith . I have scheduled an appointment for you on Wednesday at 9:30 am .
Thank you very much .
You ' re welcome .
All right .
So , what do we do now ?
This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords .
Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ' ll deposit one month ' s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ' s rent in advance . I understand that I ' ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs .
Yes . If you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out .
Can I pay you by check ?
Sure . A check will be fine .
Is there a laundry room in the basement ?
Yes .
Can I sign the lease right now ?
To the ministry government hall .
Take the same number bus going other direction . There ' s stop right cross the street .
Thank you .
I wash and you'll dry .
OK . Let's do it .
Yes , I need to refill it today .
Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice .
I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not .
Well , it looks like you have . You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out . Can you just refill it once more ?
I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription . And this prescription has run out .
But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription .
Miss , I understand your problem . But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it . We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never .
But I have a prescription . I just need more of it .
A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law . You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor . It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens . But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry .
This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it .
Maybe that's true . I don't know . But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too .
Please explain why you are interested in leaving your current position and please elaborate on your technical skills .
I am looking for a growth opportunity , which I feel is not available at my current employer . In terms of skills , I am Microsoft certified in Windows XP and several other operating system
Where do you see yourself five years from now ?
I see myself in a management position .
You'd better get up , or you'll be late .
What're you talking about ? My alarm even hasn't gone off yet .
Yes , it did . It went off thirty minutes ago . You slept right through it . You're like a dead person while you sleep .
I must have slept right through it .
Rise and shine ! Sleepyhead !
Just let me sleep five more minutes .
The early bird gets the worm .
I know , I know . But I don't want any worms .
Ha ! Ha ! If you don't make an effort now , later on it'll be a lot tougher for you .
How do you like them ?
Not bad .
I always have the temptation to eat something there .
Then , why didn't you do that ?
I don't know how much we can trust them . Do you have any ideas ?
Some of them , I think , are not good .
It doesn't taste good ?
No , I mean some of them are not clean enough .
That's my greatest concern . But how can you tell which one is clean ?
I judge by appearances .
I got it . I think it's worth trying .
It certainly is .
I'd like to try some kebab , roasted squid , and many different appealing things .
Don't try everything at one time , please .
I see . Thank you .
Dad , but I don't want to share a room with Peter . He snores every night .
Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ?
Alright . Maybe it's the only way to do it .
You can always spot the newbies . I can give you a few pointers if you want . Were you trying to use this machine here ?
Yeah ! I just started my training today and I ' m not really sure where to begin .
It ' s ok , I know how it is . This machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ?
Well , I don ' t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio .
In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ' s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ' s a lot of weight !
It ' s not that much . Just watch ... I ' m ok ...
But I heard other stores were having great mark-downs on this item .
Ours are of really good quality .
I see , please wrap it .
What's the climate like in your country ?
It's very pleasant .
What's the weather like in spring ?
It's often windy in March . It's always warm in April and May , but it rains sometimes .
What's it like in summer ?
It's always hot in June , July and August . The sun shines every day .
Is it cold or warm in autumn ?
It's always warm in September and October . It's often cold in November and it rains sometimes .
Is it very cold in winter ?
It's often cold in December , January and February . It snows sometimes .
Thank you . I think I will go there .
Well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period .
Is there any flexibility on that ?
Unfortunately , not .
OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan .
Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away .
Totally agree . What is your solution ?
Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy .
You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
But I don ' t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .
I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
The city square , please .
Are you in a hurry ?
Yes , I have to be there to meet a friend at 5 thirty pm . So we're sure we can get there on time ?
I'm afraid not , sir . Generally we can , but you know how it is in the rush hour now .
I see . Here's the extra 5 $ for you if you can get me there on time .
All right . I'll do my best .
Oh . we made it . Thank you . How much do I own you ?
The reading on the kilometer is 12 $ .
Here's the money , keep the changes , please .
Do you need a receipt ?
No , thank you .
What are your salary expectations now ?
I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 120,000 Yuan per year .
That's a little more than we had planned .
I think you'll find I'm worth that .
I can only offer you 110,000 Yuan a year . Raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance . Is that satisfactory ?
Yes , it is quite reasonable .
Now , tell me , what do you eat ?
Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .
Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
What do you drink ?
Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
What do you drink ?
I have no idea how to use the ATM .
What do you mean ?
This will be my first time using an ATM .
I can help you with that .
Explain to me how to use it .
Just put your card into the machine .
Now what do I do ?
Then you need to type in your PIN .
Now what ?
Just click on one of the choices they give you , and that ' s it .
That sounds pretty good ! How much is it ?
It's $ 4 . 25 cents by the glass . The whole bottle is $ 22 . 5 .
I'd like a bottle please .
I'll need to see your ID please .
Here you go .
Sorry about the inconvenience , you look so young . I had make sure you are over 21 years old .
Let's see ... I'm afraid the 16th is fully booked . But I have seats for the 17th .
The 17th will be fine .
And what date will you be returning ?
Hmm , I guess on the 28th .
Okay , you ' re booked on American Airlines flight 710 , departing JFK at 6:40 p . m . on September 17th . Your return flight is flight 711 , departing London ' s Heathrow Airport at 11:15 a . m . on September 28th .
Sounds good . Thanks a lot .
They're a little bit too long , so I'd like about half an inch taken off them .
All right , sir . They should be ready for you by tomorrow afternoon .
Thank you very much .
It's our pleasure .
Beneficial ? I don ' t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating .
But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency .
I doubt that .
I know it's old , but what make is it ?
It's a Chevrolet . Why do you ask ? You going into the car business ?
Nothing like that . My cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him , so he's going to sell it - cheap . It's practically new .
well I have been thinking about getting a newer car . I can't afford a brand new one .
Would you like to look at my cousin's car ?
Is it a four-door or a two-door ?
It's a coupe with a vinyl roof .
Does it have automatic transmission ? .
Yes , and it also has power steering , power brakes , and air conditioning .
I guess I might take a look at it .
How about the one on Baker Street ?
Oh , I've never seen a better Mexican restaurant .
Good morning , please make yourself comfortable .
Thank you , sir .
Your name and examination number , please .
My name is Du Tao , number 3 .
Pardon ?
Du Tao . D-U for Du and T-A - 0 for Tao .
Yes , Mr . Du , when were you born ?
I was born on January 1st , 1988 . I ' m 20 years old now .
Where do you live ?
I ' m living at Room 222 , Building 18 , N . P . U .
Can you leave me your phone number ?
Gladly , 8962105 2 .
I hate dentists .
Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .
It always hurts . I hate going .
Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
O . K . , O . K . , I ' ll go .
Good . You feel better after you do .
Really ? Why ?
Well , it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it .
I see . You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ?
That's right . You should give it up , too . It ' s bad for your health .
Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying .
But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started . Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip !
What do you mean ? What are you talking about ?
I mean you couldn't give it up !
Masha and Hero are getting divorced .
You are kidding . What happened ?
Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce .
That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ?
Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out .
That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ?
Early in the New Year I guess .
That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out .
Sure , for at least three thousand per month .
That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for .
I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent .
I know what you ' re saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy .
Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? It won ' t take more than a half hour , will it ?
Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off .
That's long leave . How's your project coming along ?
The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on .
Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave .
Thank you , Mr . Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr . Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients .
Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed .
I will . Many thanks , Mr . Black .
Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them .
You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ?
Sounds good . May I have a look ?
Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on .
They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs .
All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality .
Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ?
This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac .
Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones .
OK , I will wrap them for you .
Take care of yourself .
It all started the day before yesterday .
You seem to have picked up some kind of infection .
What should I do ?
Take a few days off from work and don't wear yourself out .
This way , please . How do you like this one ? It's made of cotton .
You have quite a range , haven't you ? I would like to see some other styles .
No , I ' m sorry , Mr . Kurt . He ' s stepped out for a bit . Would you like me to have him call you ?
Yeah , that ' ll be great . I ' m on extension 4283 .
Five keys and a small foot ornament .
What a shame ! I didn't see them .
Well , can you help me look for it ? That's my first time here .
Sure . It's my pleasure . I'd like to help you look for the missing keys .
It's very kind of you .
It's not a big deal . Hey , I found them .
Oh , thank God ! I don't know how to thank you , guys .
You're welcome .
Thank you . Please fill out the Baggage Declaration Form .
All right . Shall I enter all my belongings ?
No , only the articles listed on the Declaration .
I'd rather get one with separated speakers . They give a clear sound .
Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony .
Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration .
What do you hope to become ?
I want to prove my true value in the electronic industry , and hopefully in the near future I would be promoted to a higher position .
Well , thank you for coming . We ' ll let you know as soon as possible .
Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control .
No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go .
Yes , We do have some choices for ladies like you . What about some green salad ?
Does it taste good ?
Sure . It's a popular dish among young ladies .
I think I'll try it .
We have three kinds of dressings for salad . Italian , French and Thousand Island . Which one would you like ?
French , please .
OK . Do you want to order something else ?
Milan Style Macaroni . Don't put sugar or salt on it , please .
How about Music Madness ?
Let me check ... yes , we got the October issue a few days ago . It's on that shelf over there .
Okay , I'll take these two magazines and a copy of Today's Post .
I did it .
Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door ?
OK . I will .
I'll have our housekeeper come right away .
I'm sorry I was too tired to fall asleep .
When you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub .
Right . Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ?
Speaking .
A . This is George .
Hello , George . What ' s up ?
This is a new product of company this year . It's oil-free .
I see . It feels very light on the skin .
It gives your skin a very natural healthy look .
I like the cool smell , too .
No , I'll call back later .
All right .
Sure . May I have your name please ?
Lincoln . That's L-I-N-C-O-L-N . Thank you .
I'll be back in ten days .
Are you in a hurry ?
I have to be there before 17 o'clock .
We'll make it except a jam . You know it's rush hour .
There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
I'll do my best .
Here's twenty dollars .
Do you have small bills ?
No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ?
Here is your receipt . Thank you .
Can you tell me the way to the Peak Tram , please ?
Certainly . Go along Queen's Road ...
Along Queen's Road ...
Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel .
Right at the Hilton .
Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral .
The Cathedral ?
Yes . Then cross the road at the next traffic lights . The Peak Tram is straight ahead . You can't miss it .
That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ?
Yes . Why ?
Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down .
Would you like us to deliver the mattress for you , sir ?
That would be great .
When do you want it delivered ?
I need it delivered tomorrow . Will that be possible ?
What time exactly ?
I need it delivered at 12 o'clock .
We can have it to you at that time .
That's not a problem ?
We will deliver your mattress tomorrow at 12 o'clock .
That's great ! Thank you very much .
Two years ago . At that time I had no problems . Now I can ' t even make out something ten meters away .
Come over here . I will test your eyes . First cover your left eye like this , and when I point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can , telling me which way the " E " points .
All right .
Good . Now the other eye .
Well , this one is worse .
Never mind , just read as far as you can .
I can only read the first three lines .
If you need any help , just let me know .
Yes . Would you like a window seat ?
If one's available , please . But not over the wing .
Thank you .
But that's what the ad said .
I'm sorry . If you look at the ad again , you'll see that the other brand is on sale .
Oh . You're right . I misread the ad .
Yes , many people make that mistake .
Well , you can't blame them . It's a confusing ad .
You're right . Many ads are like that .
Well , as long as I'm here .
Just one second , and I'll give you the batteries that are on sale .
Oh , no problem .
Great . I forgot to ask you , though . How long did you want the place ?
Six months .
Oh , well , that might be a problem . I usually only sign one year leases .
Well , one year would be fine , too . I ' m not planning on leaving the area anytime soon .
Well , if it ' s not a problem . Then here you go .
Just let me look at it quickly .
Of course .
Looks like a standard lease .
Yeah , and don ' t worry about the security deposit . If everything ' s all right when you move out , you ' ll get it back .
O . K . Great . Just sign and date it here ?
Yes . Thanks . You can move your stuff in tomorrow .
Wonderful .
Is that a guided tour ?
Yes , it is .
That's fine . Let's get on the bus .
RIB 8,000 , please . Would you please tell me my balance ?
Yes , sir . Your balance is RIB 34,000 .
It ' s just the right size-a perfect fit ! Have you seen anything you like ?
I ' m thinking about buying this sweater . I know it ' s June now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
It looks too big for you , but I like the color and the material is good quality . Is it on sale ?
Yes , it ' s half price . It ' s supposed to be too large--that ' s the fashion .
I might get one too , but in a different color . I prefer light blue to white .
There . It looks great , don ' t you think ? I ' m going to get these jeans as well . I need a new pair . I ' m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter .
I ' m getting this beret ? Doesn ' t it look cool ? I ' d like to get some jeans too , but I don ' t have enough cash on me .
Don ' t worry . I ' Ve got my credit card . You can pay me back later .
Thanks ! Now I don ' t need to come back to the shop a second time .
We look forward to your settlement at an early date .
We will inform you as soon as possible .
That is very kind of you . I ' m just running out of glue .
You ' re welcome .
Yes , and I don't want to be interrupted .
I understand .
Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right .
Right ? OK , got it .
Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ?
Next left then right ? OK .
Yes , I called you last week from New York . My name is George Lee .
Wait a second , PLS . Yes , Mr . Lee , we have a room reserved for you . How long do you plan to stay ?
Probably two days . My wife will join me tomorrow . Then we will decide when to leave for Seattle .
Would you sign the register , PLS ?
By the way , does my room have a private bath ?
Certainly , every room in this hotel has a private bath .
Does my room have twin beds or a double ? I prefer a room with twin beds .
Your room has twin beds , Mr . Lee . It also has a view . I am sure you will like it . This is your key . It's on the eighth floor room 801 . The elevator's over there .
Thank you . One more thing , where is your restaurant ?
The restaurant is on the second floor . We also have a cafeteria on the top floor . If you would like something to drink , you can either call room service or come down here . The bar is right behind the lobby .
Thank you , you are very kind !
You are welcome !
I see . A set for appetizers and another for the main course .
Right . We do the same thing at home . Don't you remember ?
Oh yeah . The big napkin goes on my lap .
Let's look at our menus .
Cindy , help me order because I'm still not very familiar with American cooking .
Well , we order appetizers first and then entrees .
Yes , we do .
How much would it be ?
From 200 to 800 .
I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ?
No problem .
I found some jeans , and a new blouse .
Go and try it on .
What do you think ?
I love that shirt on you .
What about the jeans ?
They don't really fit you right .
I don't think so either .
That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though .
Well , I'll just buy the shirt .
That would be a good idea .
Who would you like to have paged again , sir ?
Mr . J . Smith .
Where would you like him to come ?
To the front desk .
Just a moment , please .
My boss offered me a promotion , and I took it .
Are you serious ?
Yes , I am really excited .
That's great . Congratulations .
I appreciate that .
You have no idea how happy I am for you .
For real ?
I believe you were the best choice for that promotion . I really do .
By the way , we would like to order some dishes for my friend .
Sure .
Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ?
Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here .
Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ?
Demographics say an average age of 28 . 7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year .
Wangfujing , please !
All right .
Oh , I like the music on your radio . It's nice .
Thank you ! I always tune to this program when driving . So what's your favorite program ?
I like Winner's English very mush . You know the Beijing Olympic Games is right around the corner . We should learn English Well . It's on FM 96 . 6 , China Business Radio . You can get it on your radio too .
But I don't speak English at all .
That's OK . The program is especially for the beginners like us .
Really ? When is it on ?
It begins at 6:40 every morning , and it goes for 20 minutes .
Thank you so much . I'll try and catch that .
The radio has brought us lots of convenience .
Yes , I can also learn about the traffic condition through it .
With the development of the society and technology , radio is nearly everywhere .
So we should take the advantage of it .
What companies do we have in our neighborhood ?
Mitsubishi , HP , IBM and many other famous corporations .
Does the 7th floor belong to our company too ?
Yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building .

What about the fight schedule ?
It departs at 12:10 and arrives at 15:10 next day .
Is it a non-stop flight ?
Yes .
Sounds good . I'd like to take this flight .
Would you prefer first class or economy class ?
Economy class .
And your name , please ?
Edward Smith .
Mr . Smith , you can get things fixed through our agencies in Guangzhou . Do remember to bring your passport with you .
Yes , many thanks . Goodbye .
Bye .
Yes . Your gold necklace has a diamond pendant , and your eardrops should be
These look wonderful . Do these come with a guarantee of quality ?
Of course . If there is anything wrong with them , you can come back and show me the guarantee of quality , and then you will surely get free service .
I ' ll take them .
I have a rash that I need a doctor to look at .
Do you have a fever with that rash ?
No , it just itches a lot .
I have openings on Tuesday or Wednesday . Which would be best for you ?
I need an appointment on Tuesday .
Fine , I am putting you down for 9
I would like to see Dr . Jones .
I can schedule you with him with no problem . We look forward to seeing you .
Of course not .
Why do you want to go to the US ?
I'd like to have further education . Now I am studying for my doctorate .
Will you get any kind of scholarship ?
Yes . The school has provided me with full scholarship and that will be enough to support myself .
You cancelled the song , didn't you , Jack ?
No , I didn't . Really !
Then , is the machine broken or ...
An international one from Seattle .
In that case , you should go to the baggage hall over there .
Oh yes , I see the sign , thank you .
Would you hold on a second , please ? Miss Cooper's extension is engaged .
Engaged . Oh , dear ! Could you tell her it's a long-distance call ?
I'm sorry , sir . I can't interrupt her . I'm sure she won't be very long .
How long do you think she'll be ?
I really can't say how long she'll be .
Can I leave a message , please ?
Yes , certainly .
Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ?
Yes , sir . I'll ring her on an inside line if you like .
Thank you very much .

My wife . She suffers from a bad cold .
What symptoms does she have ?
Fever and a bad cough .
I see . Don't worry , just a common cold .
What kind of medicine does she need ?
Patulin will be enough .
How many pills for each time ?
Nine pills per day , and three pills after each meal .
Thank you very much .
It's my pleasure .
Yes . There is a 20 % to 40 % discount . It depends on the season . During the summer the discount is 20 % . During the winter it is 40 % .
I need five single rooms in October . How much of a discount can I get ?
Our summer season ended in September . So the discount will be 40 % . That ' s a good deal . Would you prefer rooms with a front view or rear view ?
Front view , please .
What date and time will you be checking in ?
October 25th around 2:00 in the afternoon .
We need you to send a deposit for 1/3 of the bill . You can send the check , or you can use the credit card .
Ok . I ' ll send a check .

Sure . My name is Anderson . My address is 109 Ferguson East , Holton . And my phone number is 309 789 1267 .
Thanks .
what currency would you like to trade in ?
I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars . Do you accept $ 100 bills ?
No problem , we can accept any denomination . How much would you like to exchange today ?
Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ?
It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7 . 45RMB . If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7 . 35 . Will that be all right ?
I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow !
I'm afraid I can't come to work today , Mr . Smith .
Oh , what's wrong with you ?
I've got a fever and a very sore throat .
Well , you sound ill over the phone .
Yes . I have to stay in bed today , but I'll be able to come tomorrow .
That's all right . Have a good rest until you feel well enough .
Thank you , Mr . Smith . Goodbye .
Goodbye , Lucy .
We spoke with you the first week we moved in about things that you promised to fix .
Where do you think you have problems ?
There is no hot water , the bedroom has a broken window , and there are rats in the kitchen .
You know , no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before .
You are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment .
I will fix these problems when I get around to it .
I will be withholding my rent check this Friday unless these problems are addressed immediately .
You can ' t do that ! It ' s illegal !
Well , do you have any for tomorrow ?
We have tickets for the matinee . It starts at 3p . m .
Ok . I ' ll take it .
Where would you like to sit ?
Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes .
Certainly .
Yes . I want some post cards and some airmail stamps . I want to send some letters to South America .
Just a moment , I'll look up the rate for air-mail letters to South America .
Can you tell me how much it will cost to send a package to Colombia ? Also , I what to know how long it will take .
Do you have the package with you ? I would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost .
Do you insure package ?
Yes . All you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for .
Is there a way that I can be sure that the people in South america receive my package ?
The post office rarely loses package . You can , however , request a rectum receipt .
One last question-what are your hours ?
We open at eight-thirty in the morning and close at five-thirty in the afternoon .
Thank you , you helped me a lot .
We ' Ve named her Alice after my wife ' s grandmother .
That ' s a pretty name . Give your wife my best !
Hi , Mr . Wang , what can I help you with ?
I need to talk with Marry .
Certainly , hold on .
Thanks .
No , these are all my personal effects .
What's in the bag ? Would you mind opening the bag ?
Not at all . I don't know what's dutiable . Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use ?
NO . You don't have to pay duty on personal belongings .
Thank you .
Well , we have a package tour there .
How much does it cost ?
$ 600 .
Does that include the insurance ?
Of course .
What we will do is to strengthen it .
Yes , this is also the competitive edge of our company .
Now , tell me what you often eat .
I often eat fish and eggs .
Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
Oh yes , and fruits . I love fruits very much .
What do you like to drink ?
Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea .
Whatever would you like to drink ?
I drink a lot of milk . I drink milk almost every day .
How often do you exercise ?
Well , I walk every day .
It's a good diet and a regular exercise .
Yes , quite right .
Can you put your hand where it hurts the most ?
It hurts smack in the middle of my gut !
Did this just come on suddenly ?
I felt OK until an hour or so ago , and then I just doubled over .
Have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently ?
No , and I don ' t usually get a lot of stomachaches .
We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is .
I think that that is the best way to figure out what is causing this . Thank you .
Sorry , but we can't do anything without the receipt . Come back with it .
I didn't know . I'll go to get it . How late will you be open ?
Till 5:30 .
Well . I am afraid it must be my fault . Can you send someone here to help me ?
OK . I will send a maid to your room right now .
I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .
It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .
It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .
We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .
Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .
If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?
We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi .
I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .
Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .
It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .
Thanks , that was nice of you .
See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !
So , let ' s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ' Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ' t they ?
Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ' t need to be replaced .
How long did it take you to do the tiling .
As I hadn ' t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether .
I think you ' Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ?
You ' ll be lucky ! However , I ' ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself .
Good idea . Have you written down potatoes , carrots , and onions ?
I don ' t have onions on my list . I ' ll add them . We should get some tea . Is green tea ok or should we get the same tea that we usually get ?
Let ' s get both . We need some coffee too . Is that on your list ?
Yes , it is . Here ' s my list . Is there anything that I ' Ve forgotten ?
I think you ' Ve got everything . I want to got some chocolate and some cheese .
What kind of cheese do you want .
I ' m not sure . I ' ll decide at the cheese counter , when I can see what they have . Have we got enough money ?
We don ' t have enough cash , so I ' ll take my credit card and we can pay with that . Where are the car keys ?
I ' Ve got them there . Shall I drive ?
Your summer clothes for white-collar and men's jackets .
Can you give us a rough idea of the quantity you require ? It is generally known that the price varies according to the quantity .
That is to say , 10000 sets for the one of white-collar and 5000 for men's jackets .
In that case , our offer for the white-collar series is US $ 200 , and the other is US $ 300 per set .
Do you quote CIF or FOB ?
We usually quote on a CIF basis and a commission of five percent for you . You will find our price is most competitive .
What are your terms of payment ?
Letter of credit at sight .
Another question . Could you tell me the earliest possible time of shipment ?
Within a month after your letter of credit reaches us .
Well , I got all the point . All the decision will be made since I get the approval from my supervisor .
OK ! I expect you to accept our general terms and conditions of trade . We believe that through our cooperation , large transactions will be brought to speedy conclusion .
I want to get a puppy for my son .
That will make him so happy .
I'll get him one of those little dogs .
One that won't grow up too big .
And eat too much .
Do you know which one he would like ?
Oh , yes , I took him there yesterday . He showed me one that he really liked .
I bet you had to drag him away .
He wanted to take it home yesterday .
I wonder what he'll name it .
What a coincidence ! These pajamas would be perfect to take along on the honeymoon !
You're probably right . Oh , what the heck ! I'll take it all ... in maroon , like you said .
Are you in robust health ?
I have a little problem , I'm overweight for my height . I think I should go on a diet .
Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
No , nothing in particular .
How soon can you begin working for us ?
I need about two to three weeks for necessary formalities . I will quit then transfer to your company .
The chicken is also nice .
No , I want the fish .
Our special tonight is lobster .
Thank you , but I prefer the fish .
Perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb .
No , I like the fish .
What ever you say ?
Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ?
This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ' m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee !
That ' s great . Can you do it anywhere ?
No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
So , what programs do you have on your laptop ?
I ' Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs .
I know you are keen on photography . It ' s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at a
It ' s wonderful , isn ' t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I took recently ?
We have Italian , French and Thousand Island .
Make it French please .
What do you do ?
I ' m a podiatrist . What about you ?
I ' m a nurse . What do you do in your free time ?
I like to play piano , go bowling and chat with my friends . And you ?
I like to hang out with my friends , play games and go swimming .
Would you like to go out some time ?
Sure , that ' d be great . Where would you like to go ?
Anywhere with you .
Aren ' t you sweet .
Do you have your passport with you ?
Yes , here you go . I don't need a visa to go to Spain , do I ?
Fortunately for you , you don't . Next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
That's good advice .
Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
Are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
Let me see here ... yes , there's one left .
Ok . I'll take that one then .
Alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
I like to travel light so I just have this one .
If that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?
Yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ?
You're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . Here's your boarding pass . Enjoy your flight !
What is your strongest trait ?
Cheerfulness and friendliness .
How would your friends or colleagues describe you ?
They say Mr . Sun is a friendly , sensitive , caring and determined person .
What personality do you admire ?
I admire a person who is honest , flexible and easy-going .
How do you get along with others ?
I get on well with others .
Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices .
That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options .
What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ?
Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into .
So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?
Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .
Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will .
After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ' m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice .
I am most interested in Pasadena or Arcadia , but would be open to other suggestions .
How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need ?
We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home .
Do you need to be located in a particular school district ?
It doesn ' t matter , as we do not have any children .
Is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ?
In a perfect world , we would like a home with a view of the lake .
Thank you for all of the information . I will help you find the perfect house for you .
Well , I think perhaps you'd better speak to our Production Manager , Mr . Yao . You'll meet him when we go over to the factory .
Your seat is three , in the third row , near the window .
Thank you . Where can I put my suitcase ?
Either in the overhead compartment or underneath the seat .
Everyone's attention , please . We are going to take off . Please fasten your belts .
The Workers'Stadium .
This is the right bus .
Will you let me know where to get off ?
Certainly . Four more stop after this . I'll call out the stops .
Thank you .
All my money .
Well . Go to the police station and see if it ' s there .
That's a good idea . We can improve our technology to meet your special need .
And please let white color dominate .
OK ! I've noted it down . And any others ?
Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city .
I'll tell them .
Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor .
Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery .
Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you .
I think so . Bye !
Bye !
Let's go out for some exercise , shall we ?
What an excellent idea !
Shall we do some jogging ?
OK .
I feel well now .
Yes , some exercise is necessary for us .
Quite right .
I haven't the slightest clue what I'm going to make .
A teriyaki bowl sounds nice .
I don't know how to make that .
All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef .
That sounds fairly simple , but how do I cook it ?
The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice .
What's next ?
Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it .
What's the next thing I need to do ?
Then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy .
OK , please put it on this scale . Airmail or by sea ?
How long does it take to reach Taiwan by sea ?
Usually about two month .
That's too long . How long does it take to reach Taiwan by airmail ?
About ten days .
Then how much is that by airmail ?
Let me see . It ' s 57 dollars , 20 cents , including tax .
That's a little bit expensive .
Although it's expensive to send it by airmail , it's quicker and safer than by sea .
I guess I have to send it by airmail .
Do you want to ensure the contents , Miss ?
Yes , please .
Please fill out this form , also please write the value of the items in this space .
OK .
That's right , even though I did set the alarm last night .
Your clock never works . Perhaps you should buy a new one .
Well , if it breaks down again tomorrow , I'll definitely buy a new one .
I ' ll have to get a couple in different colors .
Me , too .
Buy them now though , or they might not still be here tomorrow .
Good idea , especially at this price .
Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ' m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg .
I don ' t know about that . with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ' t know if you ' re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ' s just too much instability . I wouldn ' t feel comfortable investing in this climate .
But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity . And anyway , I ' m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example . they have 1 . 4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .
Come on , son , you ' re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .
Fine , then ! If that ' s the way you feel , so be it . But you ' re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ' m going to go hit up Mum for the cash .
That's nothing new .
I'll buy an electric map of the city .
You've had so long a flight .
Time difference also makes me feel weak .
Oh , I forgot about it .
It's four o'clock in the morning in Chicago now , but it's time to go to bed in Shanghai .
Don't think so much . Take a good sleep and you'll feel better soon .
I kind of want pizza .
I ate pizza the other day .
So , what do you feel like eating then ?
How about some burgers ?
I already had a burger yesterday .
What are we going to do ?
We can just each get what we want to get .
That sounds like a plan .
Do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ?
I think they sell both at the cafeteria .
With pleasure . We arrange two kinds of tourist programs for Suzhou , a six-day tour by train and a five-day flying journey .
How much does a six-day tour by train cost ?
Five hundred yuan .
Does that include hotels and meals ?
Oh , yes , and admission tickets for places of interest as well .
That sounds reasonable . What about the five-day flying journey ? How much is that ?
Eight hundred and fifty yuan .
Covering all expenses ?
Yes . But there is no half fare for children . They must pay full fare .
Each mp belongs to a political party , right ?
Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ' s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime Finist
What ' s a cabinet ?
This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ' s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
Can any mp make a law ?
Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law .
I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ' s . most mp ' s vote the way their party wants them to .
How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Voters who often change the party they vote for are Calle
That's great . Will I feel hot there ? I feel sensitive to heat .
It's not so hot as it is here .
Please don't make it too tight . This is for autumn wear , so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath .
I see , sir . Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th , that's in a week's time ?
The 10th ? I'm sorry , but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th . Could you have the suit ready by the 8th , or at the latest , the 9th ?
Well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . But in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . How about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ?
That's fine , thank you .
No , the other one in the brown case .
Oh , this one ... Here .
May I try it ?
Sure .
It's very smooth . I'll take it .
Cash or charge ?
Charge , please .
What sales do they have today ?
I'm sure something is on sale . Please check with the produce person .
Could you tell me how to get there ?
I ' m afraid I can ' t because I ' m a stranger here .
Oh , thanks all the same .
Not at all . You can ask the policeman over there .
Sure . Would you like to have the loaf sliced ?
No , that's OK . Do you have any whole wheat bread ?
We are out at the moment . May I suggest some rye bread ?
Sure that sounds good . Do you have any cakes ?
We have various birthday cakes and also ice cream cakes .
I'll just take a cheesecake .
Will that be all ?
Yes .
Your total is forty three dollars and twenty cents .
May I know who's calling ?
This is Li Ping of ABC computer company limited . I'm calling on our Mr Wilson the general manager of our company .
I'm sorry , Mrs Li , Mr Brown is now in a meeting . May I have your number , and ask him to call you back later ?
I'm afraid Mr Wilson would like to speak to Mr Brown right now . He ' s got an urgent matter to discuss with Mr Brown without delay .
Ok , then would you please hold the line ? Mr Li , the line is through , Mr Brown is ready answering the call , go ahead .
Thank you for your assistance , Mr Bush .
You are welcome .
Did you work as a salesperson before , Mrs . Vale ?
Only as a clerk in a store .
I see . Well , consulting is a little different .
I'm a quick leamer , Mr . Jenkins .
Umm hmm . Do you have a diver's license ?
Yes , and I'm a very good driver .
Fine . We provide a company car for our consultants .
Do I have to travel a lot ?
Oh yes-five days a week . You have to visit customers all over the territory .
But how will I get to know the products ?
You'll have to attend a three-week course . If you do well , the job is yours .
How much is the salary ?
Starting salary is $ 150 a week-plus commissions , of course .
How much commission do your consultants get ?
Five percent .
Well , I'm very interested in the job .
Fine . The next course starts a week from tomorrow .
Thank you .
Good luck to you .
What ' s up ?
Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?
Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout .
This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ?
I am still waiting for their call .
Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward .
How do you like your steaks ?
I'd like it medium-well .
OK , sir , wait a minute .
No problem . Could I have the cash and your Bank Book , please ? Oh dear ... there seems to be some problems here ...
What ? What's wrong ?
I'm sorry but 5 of these notes seem to be counterfeit . Look at this watermark , do you see it ?
It does look a little strange , I didn't notice that before .
I'm afraid not , sir .
Oh ? That's a surprise . Let me see ... D 0411 Our dog's birthday . Yes , I'm sure this my parking space !
But I saw a red car always parking here before .
Oh , we've just repainted our car . It was red .
Maybe . But the car of this space has a broken rearview mirror on the left .
Yeah . It used to . We got that fixed yesterday too .
Could you wait for a minute , sir ? I'd like to have a check .
Sure , go ahead .
Sorry , sir , my mistake . This is your parking space .
That's all right . It's not your fault .
It's . I think , neighbours on the right .
You mean the room thirteen-thirteen ?
I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhausted , but I can't sleep .
All right , ma'am . I'll check and tell them to be quiet .
If next room is still noisy , could you give me a different room , please ?
Shall we meet at 1:15 this Thursday ? We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .
Fine , I'll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday .
Why ? You are so excellent .
I think the only reason is that I was too nervous during the interview and I couldn't express myself the way I wanted to .
What a shame ! You should have showed yourself to them !
It doesn't matter . I'll try other companies .
I suggest you hunt for a job on the Internet .
On the Internet ? I've never heard of it .
It's very convenient and it has become popular recently .
Is that safe ?
Of course , if you log on some standard websites .
Thank you for your advice . I'll have a try .
I want to put my desk over there , but it's too heavy for me to move .
Okay , you take one end and I'll take the other .
Oh , no ! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning .
Is that right ? We're very sorry .
I thought it was " the same day " service . Anyway , please do hurry .
I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock .
Well , then , would you send it to Japan , please ?
Yes , we'll do so .
Sure .
OK , I ' ll be right back .
I'm sorry , but Mr . Thomas left the office a few minutes ago .
That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy . Will he be back soon ?
I'm afraid not . He's gone for the rest of the day .
Is there anywhere I can reach him ?
I don't believe so . He's going out of town on business . May I take a message ?
I have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , but I'm afraid I can't make it .
Would you care to make another appointment ?
Unfortunately , I'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and I may be gone for several days .
I see . I can tell Mr . Thomas that you phoned .
Thank you .
Bye-bye .
Certainly sir , For which day and time please ?
Tonight at seven .
I'm sorry sir , but we are fully booked tonight until eight .
In that case , eight o'clock is fine .
Very well , and how many people will attend tonight ?
Four people .
Lastly , may I please know what name I should make the reservation under ?
Mark .
Good . I wanna come with you .
How strange ! Our little emperor now asks to help out with shopping .
We learnt about vegetables and meat at school . But I never see the real thing .
Wow , that's something new . Let's go ! What's this , honey ?
Er , is it cabbage ?
Cabbage ? Is that what they teach at school now ? OK , honey , it's spinage .
Yeah , I know , this is Popeye's favorite food .
There we go .
Mom , come here . I know this , it is carrot , am I right ?
Bingo ! It's dark outside , Let's hurry up .
Really ? Then , I guess I won ' t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
Actually , you might because there ' s a big convention in town this weekend .
I ' m not too worried about it . I always seem to find something .
Yes .
But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate .
So you must be an extravert ?
Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them .
What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ?
A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment .
Don't you consider it a hard work ?
Hard but interesting , I think .
Have you any experience as a tourist guide ?
Yes , I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University .
Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English ?
Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well .
Well , the bigger the better , I think .
Look at this one . It's our biggest pan .
Yes , that is big enough , but it's too heavy for me .
Okay , we have the same thing in aluminum .
Oh , this is nice and light . But it has an aluminum handle .
Try this one . Same aluminum pan , but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle .
Oh , yes . This is very nice . I'll take this one .
That's a good choice . How do you want to pay for it ?
Cash . Oh , I almost forgot . I need a lid , too .
I'm so sorry . A lid comes with the pan . Here it is .
Some aspirin or Panadol should help . You can pick some up at the pharmacy when you go to fill your prescription .
Okay .
Goodbye , Randy . Take care .
What I need you to do first is fill in these forms , with as much detail as possible . Then we can get you a new card .
So , I can get my new card today ?
I'm sorry , Sir , the full procedure can take up to 7 days to process everything .
7 days ! What am I supposed to do for money until then ?
If you bring some ID with you , it's possible for you to make a withdrawal over the counter if you need to . But unfortunately , without your new card you cannot use the ATM , so all withdrawals must be made within working hours .
I've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed .
What's your flight number ?
Flight CA216 to Chengdu .
Yes , it's true . It has been delayed .
Could you please tell me why ?
Yes , of course . The delay is due to heavy rain .
How long will the delay be ? Do you have any further information about it ?
I am sorry , we don't know the extent of the delay at present . But according to the latest weather forecast , there will be a change in weather soon .
We have to wait . Well , is it possible for the rain to stop before noon ?
It's hard to say . Weather is so changeable in the summer . Please listen to the latest announcement about your flight .
Yes , I will . Thanks a lot . Bye !
Bye
Oh , I remember now . Very nice to meet you again .
Nice meeting you , too .
Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly .
Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas .
I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails .
So you have to open all the envelopes .
Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly .
Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas .
Come on ! In the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song !
I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night .
Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him . He loves " The King . "
I'll put the song at the front of the list .
Yes , it's important to be all clued up before you enter into any agreement . To make full use of the Network Settlement Service and take advantage of the whole banking system , we provide internal fund transfers , account inquiry , agency clearing to name but a few .
So , do you think our corporation will be eligible for this ?
Yes , and it's extremely simple . All you need to do is make a Network Settlement Agreement with us .
what's your favorite animal ?
it's hard to say . While dogs are more affectionate , cats are much easier to take care of .
have you ever had a dog ?
when I was little , we had a few domestic dogs at home .
they always say that dogs are a man's best friends . do you think that's true ?
definitely . rich or poor , dogs always love their masters .
how about cats ? Have you ever had one for a pet ?
i had one a few months ago , but she ended up running away .
how did that happen ?
she left through a window that was open one night and never returned .
you must have been devastated !
i was pretty sad . i still hope that she'll return some day !
I hope she does . Do you think you'll ever get another pet ?
I think I will . It's difficult to feel longly when you have a pet around .
i hope your cat finds its way back home .
i do , too .
Let's take our time and enjoy the art and sprite of the famous museum .
What a shame that we can't take pictures .
Woo cool . Which mountain are you going to conquer ?
We haven't made up our minds . Will you come with us ?
Of course , I will .
I have an appointment in half an hour .
I see .
Do you have anything else I can have instead ?
Well sir , yes . How about this stew ? We can serve you at once .
I ' ll take this stew then .
Our employees receive fifteen days of paid vacation every year . If you don ' t use the full fifteen days , they carry over to the following year .
How about sick days ?
You get five paid sick days .
Any other benefits ?
Yes , we have an excellent retirement plan and medical insurance as well .
Great . Thanks so much for your time .
We ' ll contact you soon , Ted . Thanks for coming in .
Do you think I can get back to work very soon ?
Don't be in such a hurry . I'm confident that you'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks .
Is there anything I should do ?
You'd better have a good rest for a week . Be sure to have regular meals . Stay away from alcohol . Give up smoking at least a little while .
Should I take some medicine ?
Yes . I'm going to give you some . Take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . For that one , two tablets . And remember to come to the out patient department for a consultation in two weeks , please .
It's very kind of you .
You're welcome . We wish you a speedy recovery . Goodbye .
A crate of beer ? Why do we need that ?
Just joking . I would like to get a few bottles of beer though . We also need a liter of cooking oil .
we can buy a three-liter bottle . It works out cheaper per liter . We should buy a packet of butter and a few pints of milk too .
I ' d like to get a jar of strawberry jam and a bottle of tomato ketchup . Do we need any meat ?
I think we should get half a kilo of minced beef and a few pork chops .
Ok . Let ' s not forget fruit and vegetables . We need a bunch of bananas , a kilo of tomatoes and a bag of potatoes .
We should also get a tube of toothpaste and a bar of soap . Let ' s get a tub of ice cream too . We can treat ourselves .
Ok . We should get a few tins of tuna . Anything else ?
I ' d like a few cans of coke . We also need a dozen eggs and half a dozen sausages .
let ' s get a chunk of cheese too . Is that everything .
I think so . I ' Ve got the shopping list , so let ' s go .
I just thought it would be an interesting way to see lots of places . How long will it take ?
Too long , and you do not have much time .
What a pity .
Why ?
We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet .
You got lost . You're kidding !
No . We took a wrong turn somewhere . And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions . But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost .
You could have called .
I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were .
You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ?
Guess where we ended up .
I don't know . Where ?
When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield .
Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ?
I don't know . The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
I know it is . I don't know how it happened .
Hmm , maybe I do .
What ?
Maybe I have an idea how it happened .
How ?
You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road .
Oh , that's what you think , huh ?
Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly .
I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable .
I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .
I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % .
I ' m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ?
We've already cut down our price to cost level .
Is that all ?
Yes , this is the best we can do .
I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered .
ok . There're vacancies . Since the peak season is coming , it's advisable to book soon . Would you like to make a reservation now ?
yes , please . Do you take credit cards ?
yes , we accept all major credit cards .
and how about Internet access ?
there's free Internet access in the lobby .
is it available in the rooms ?
Unfortunately not .
that's OK . Is breakfast included ?
yes , breakfast is included and parking is available .
fantastic . Thank you very much .
you're welcome . And we have 24 hour reception . Please don't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions .
What's your name ?
My name is James .
What's your nationality ?
American .
What's your relationship with the victim ?
I don't know him .
Why did you attack the victim ?
Because he beat me first when I tried to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away .
How many times did you stab the victim ?
I stabbed his belly three times .
Did you know hat your actions might cause serous injuries or death ?
I knew , but I couldn't control myself .
Was it your intention to kill the victim ?
No . I didn't kill him on purpose , madam . It's him who caused the incident . I need to see my attorney .
OK . Give me his number and we'll contact him .
No . Every spring time around April , I'm stricken with allergies .
I never have seasonal allergies .
Consider yourself lucky .
What are all the symptoms ?
Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water .
That doesn't sound good .
No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ?
Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family .
Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol .
I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body .
That's pretty bad .
But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah .
Be careful ! The road is muddy . You might slip .
Thanks for the warning .
Yes , but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
Yes , I have a lot of previous experiences in sales . I worked in sales departments for two companies since I finished my university .
That sounds fine . Please give me your name and phone numbers . I ' ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . It will most likely be in a couple of days . Is it all right for you ?
Yes , my name is Brian and my phone number is 5294870 .
Thank you .
You ' Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ?
Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . .
I ' m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time !
I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ' t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures .
I ' m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP !
What will that tell me ?
The Award Letter will tell you how much you will receive weekly .
Are there any other forms that I need to fill out ?
You will need to fill out a Continued Claim Form every two weeks .
What information will I need to provide on that form ?
They will need to know where you worked and how much money you made .
Are there any other questions on the form ?
Basically , they want to know that you were available for work and not sick .
No ! Stop playing computer games !
Mom , I'll be finished soon .
Peter , if you don't turn off your computer , then I won't allow you to play it again starting next week .
What kind of vegetable are you thinking about making ?
Do you know what kind of vegetable you want to eat ?
Why don't you make some corn ?
How would you like the corn ?
I don't understand what you mean .
Do you want it boiled , grilled , or microwaved ?
Why don't you grill it ?
That's how you want it ?
Yeah , that sounds delicious .
Okay , I'll grill some corn then .
that's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
me , too . What did you have in mind ?
I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must .
I agree . They're very lovely , especially " Huan Huan " .
is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ?
the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive .
oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ?
I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now .
any other ideas ?
there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts .
it all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have .
Thanks .
May I ask , sir , if you enjoyed your stay ?
Well , except for one night , I enjoyed the hotel . And I loved New York , of course .
Thank you for your honesty . I assure you there will be no cockroaches next time .
Can you tell me what time we're arriving ?
Sure . Let me see ... at 6:15 a . m . local time .
I see .
And that'll be 10:15 p . m . Beijing time .
I see . And how about the working hours ?
Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times .
Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ' s not really a shock for me .
Good , as long as you understand that .
And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ?
Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month .
That sounds ideal .
Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .
Sure . It's probably the skiing show . Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
See that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .
Hey , don't be so pathetic . It's a maximal sports show . What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ?
They are all very experienced and great skiers . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow in here ?
Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ?
Hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist .
Sorry . Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .
Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
It's possible . But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
It's a good thing . OK , let's go skiing .
Here we go .
Well , I need to confirm the time of their classes .
Ok , where can I find their telephone number ?
They are all listed here on this sheet of paper .
Is it their home , office or cell phone numbers ?
Unless it ' s marked differently , it ' s their home numbers .
Alright . What if I can ' t get a hold of them by phone ?
Then , you should e-mail them with the information .
Where can I find their e-mail addresses ?
They should have then listed on their resumes .
And if there aren ' t any e-mail addresses ?
Then send them a SMS on their cell phone .
Ok . That sounds easy enough . Have you called any of them yet ?
Yes . I called the first three people on the list , but they didn ' t pick up .
Did you leave a voice message ?
I left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list .
I see . What did you tell her ?
I told her that she should call me back at my office number .
Ok , so , maybe I should call her again .
Yes , that sounds like a good idea . She might not get the other message in time .
One more question . It looks like some of these numbers are long-distance . Do you have a calling card that I can use to get through to them ?
Sure . You can use this one . The pin number is written on the back of the card .
Alright . Thanks a lot . Don ' t worry . I ' ll take care of it .
Great work . I ' m off for the weekend ! See you on Monday .
See you .
Yes , sir . What would you like ?
Orange juice , scrambled eggs , bacon , toast and coffee .
OK , and when shall I bring it here ?
About seven thirty . By the way , could you also bring me tomorrow's papers ?
Of course , sir .
Are you completely out ?
No , I have some , but not enough for the long weekend .
Okay . I ' ll send someone to deliver it for you tomorrow .
Thank you .
No problem .
Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How's your schedule look ?
Let me see . I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday .
Great .
The journey is worth while . Where are we going after this ?
We will visit the Statue of Liberty as scheduled .
Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ?
It's fish steamed and served with our special sauce .
Is it good ?
Sure . It's a most popular dish .
I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together .
We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ?
What kind do you have ?
We have French and Thousand Island .
Make it Thousand Island .
Do you think Kentucky fried chicken is good ?
Sure sounds good to me .
Ah , hello Quinn . Oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , aren't you ?
I'm afraid so , yes .
Hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! Is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ?
Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake .
What do you recommend we do ?
I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible .
I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now .
Can you work under pressure ? You know , people working here are all busy everyday since we're daily newspaper .
I think I've got used to work under pressure . I will adjust myself to the step of your newspaper quickly .
I ' m not sure how .
I don ' t understand .
I ' Ve never used one before .
I can help you figure it out .
What do I have to do ?
Slide your card into the machine .
Then what ?
You need to type your PIN in .
What do I have to do next ?
Click on whichever option you want , and you ' re done .
Your assistant gave wonderful directions .
Why are you switching jobs at this point in your career ?
Our Company is moving overseas and I wish to stay in the United States .
What are you best at ?
I am good at organizing systems that have been having problems .
What is your biggest challenge in terms of skills ?
I don ' t like to sit around and so like to always find things to do to keep myself busy .
That is good to hear !
Go straight up Zhongshan Road and you will see our sign on your right , after you pass the museum .
Thank you very much .
For business or pleasure ?
Business .
Thank you . Have a pleasant stay .
So many stops ! Don't you have any direct flights ?
Sorry sir , it is the only flight wa have right now .
Can I try later then ?
Yes , of course .
Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ?
Well , uh ... I ' m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ?
Do you mind if I sit down ?
Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ?
I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ?
Yes . But why should you want to do that ?
Do you mind if I speak frankly ?
Not at all . Go ahead .
Well . You see , I don ' t like the office . I don ' t like the staff . And I ' m afraid of you . And I don ' t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ?
Yes . I ' d be delighted if you did .
Um , ninety-five dollars ?
Yes , that ' s the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ?
I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen ' s Boutique . I didn ' t know I could get it cheaper somewhere else .
Of course ! Everything at Helen ' s is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn ' t you shop around ?
I don ' t know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive .
Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then .
What about cats ? They are more independent .
Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat .
How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ?
Yeah , are they easy to look after ?
Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything .
Could I have one for tomorrow morning ?
Could I see your driver's license ?
Sure here it is .
Good . Now just complete this form .
We hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings .
Of course not . We have cooperated for a long time .
OK , sir . Is there anything valuable or breakable in it ?
Well ... there is a necklace in it .
Would you mind taking the necklace with you , or leaving it at the safe deposit box ?
Well , don't bother . I'll take it with me . Will that be all right ?
Thank you , sir . Here is your tag . This cloakroom is open till 11:00 p . m . , could you pick it up by then ?
Sure . thank you .
I am calling to say thank you for the interview yesterday .
You are welcome . I am very impressed by your capability .
Is there anything I should do ?
No , nothing . It's thoughtful of you to call me again .
Thank you . Please call me at any time if you have any questions .
Ok , I will . Do you have any question ?
No , thank you . Goodbye .
Goodbye .
That sounds nice . I can peel the potatoes first .
Really ! Oh , honey , you are so sweet . I'll chop up this carrot .
Mom , the water is boiling !
Honey , just turn down the stove .
So , you are leaving , aren't you ?
yes , I'm going to take a holiday tomorrow .
How nice ! I can see you are busying packing . I'm sorry to interrupt you .
That's all right . I'm almost finished . Do you need my help ?
Yes , could you please go over this for me ? and see if there is any mistake in it ?
Oh . all right I'll read it soon .
Excuse me for taking your time .
It's nothing Navy .
Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment .
Is that so ?
Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .
Have you decided ?
Yes . I want to get a better job .
Could you tell me why you want to quit ?
I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?
I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .
OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
Thank you so much for your advice .
And every best wish for your new job .
Thank you .
Yes . We have an appointment at eight o ' clock .
What ' s your name , please ?
Robert . Philips Robert .
I want to speak to you about this year ' s election .
Oh , really ?
Yes , I am a volunteer for the campaign .
I am very impressed .
I feel that history is about to be made , and I want to be a part of it .
That is very nice of you .
Will you be voting ?
Yes , I am going to vote .
Make sure you make it to your polling place early on Election Day .
Thank you and good luck .
Yes , please sit on the chair . How do you want to have your hair cut ?
Not too long . Cut a little off behind and on both sides , too .
OK . Now lean back a little and keep still . I'm going to shave your face .
Which type of gas do you want ? Regular , Super , or Premium Unleaded ?
What's the price difference ?
Regular is $ 1 . 15 , Super is $ 1 . 25 and Premium is $ 1 . 39 .
Just fill it up with Regular , Unleaded , please .
Do you want me to check the tires and the fluids ?
Yes , I would . Thanks a lot .
I'm calling about the apartment for rent on Main Street .
Would you be interested in seeing the apartment ?
I would love to see it .
Are you free today at around 6 p . m . ?
Yes , I will be able to make it then .
Well , I'll see you at 6 p . m . Do you know how to get there ?
I used to live in that area .
I'll give you an application form when I see you .
That sounds good . Do I need to bring anything ?
No . Just bring yourself .
Where do you want to be in 5 years ?
I don't want to have a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing .
That sounds very reasonable .
It's the most important thing to me .
If you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ?
That obviously depends on how things go - - whether I'm suited to the firm and the firm to me .
Tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them .
I want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . In order to achieve this goal , I just want to work step by step .
What is your long-range objective ?
I haven't thought it over at all .
What do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ?
I think the most important thing is the interest in the job .
The first thing we do is check the feel of the paper ;d oes it feel too thick or too thin ? Then we check the watermark . In my opinion it is counterfeit . I'll just run it through the scanner to double check .
What happens now ?
Well , it's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . So , unfortunately you'll lose this 50 RIB . We'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
Jog ?
Then , you are to walk to work .
Walk ?
Thirty minutes in gym at lunch time .
Oh no .
Use the stairs , never the elevator .
Oh , dear .
And three times a week , you can either swim , play racketball , or hand ball .
Oh no .
OK , you can stop now . It ' s time for the dance class .
Dance class ! I don't know how .
You will .
Oh ...
Oh , good . That'll be the number forty four ?
No , it's the number fifty-eight .
So when's the next forty-four ? Will it be here soon ?
No , it won't .
So when will it be here then ?
Never .
Never ?
That's right . The number forty-four doesn't stop here any more . Its stop is round the corner .
Well , the tapestry is delicate and beautiful .
You have made an excellent choice , it is our newcomer . The tapestry is on hot sell with the design and quality . The design on it is traditional Paris architecture .
How much is it ?
100 frances .
Mmm , it is reasonable . Look at this set of table wear , it is so beautiful !
We have a piece of table clothing to go with it . It is a brocade one with pretty stars .
This silver vase is a good ornament for the living room .
You are right .
I will take the tapestry , the set of table wear and the vase .
OK . Do you like these candles ? They are on sale now .
All right . I will take one .
Well , it's eaten my card ! It won't give it back !
I see ... calm down , don't worry . May I ask what were you doing when it took your card ?
Yes . I was only entering my PIN . I'm terrible at remembering it , I'm so forgetful , you see .
Mmmm ... and exactly how many times did you enter it , please ?
Maybe three times . As I said , I always forget it .
Ah ! Don't worry ; it's just a security measure . If someone uses a card and cannot get the right PIN after three attempts , the bank keeps the card in case it's stolen . Just contact the bank and we'll get it back to you .
Oh , I see . So if I call my branch they can sort everything out for me ?
Yes , they'll be happy to help . Believe me , it happens to many people .
I'd better try harder to memorise my PIN in future . Thanks .
You look quite mature beside your cousin who is eighteen .
You can bet on that .
This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you .
Thank you , I will be doing my best .
Hurry up , the show is about to start .
It looks like you're very interested in the circus .
Yes , I love to see the animal show .
I have never seen those before , but since you're so excited it should be good .
I'm sure you'll love it .
Okay , I will go and get some popcorn first .
What about supply of parts to the production line ?
Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line .
What about the smaller components ?
They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory .
Is there anything cheaper than that ?
If you're in school , you can get a student pass .
Well , I am how much will that cost ?
The pass is free .
I don't have to pay for anything ?
You'll only have to pay for the monthly sticker .
How much is the monthly sticker ?
It's $ 24 for each month .
I'll take the student bus pass .
Okay , I'll get you one .
Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response for any click .
I have the same question . I can ' t send out mails . We ' d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately .
Ok .
Wait a second , Vince . You know what ? Why don't you let me handle it ?
Are you sure ? Do you have somebody in mind ?
Yeah . Let me see if he'll do it , and I'll get back to you .
OK . Just keep in mind it has to be somebody who can get along with Elvin .
Don't sweat it . I know just the guy .
So you're quite confident in your experience and skill
I think so .
I will be voting tomorrow .
What ' s your polling place ?
My polling place is at the park up the street .
Oh , yeah ?
Yeah , where is yours ?
I don ' t know .
How is it you don ' t know ?
The location of my polling place never came in the mail .
You can always just check online .
Let me go do that .
What's the room rate ? It is a little expensive for me , do you have any other rooms ?
Then how about this room , with just shower ?
May I see the room ? I ' ll take this room . Is the rate for the room only ?
No , sir . The tax is included .
I got hungry and bought some chips .
That was smart .
Anyway , do you have any change I can use for the bus ?
I don't have any .
I don't know how I'm going to get home .
Get a transfer from the bus driver .
How much is a transfer ?
It doesn't cost anything .
That's great ! Thanks for your help .
You know what ? Don't mention it .
What are you going to do ? Are you going to work late ?
No , I'm not . I'm going to look for an apartment .
An apartment ? Why ?
I'm going to try to find a place near the office .
Where are you living now ?
Out in the suburbs . It's a long trip to work every day .
How are you going to find an apartment ?
I'm going to buy a newspaper and check the classified ads .
Apartments in the city are expensive .
I know , but I'm going to enroll in a night school to take a course in business management .
Really ?
Yes , but the offer only lasts this week .
OK . Here you are .
Well , ou can't hear music until takeoff .
I see . Thank you .
Oh , hello ! Sorry about that . I'm just calling to say that we've received your new Corporate Credit Card from HQ .
That was quick ! I wasn't expecting it until later this week .
Yes , our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast-track system .
Shall I come in and collect it ?
Or we can send it to you . But if you would like to use it at the ATM , you'll need to wait for your PIN number .
Mmmm ... if I come in and collect it this afternoon , is there any way I could use it today ? Petty cash is getting low , so I need to draw some money .
As long as you bring your ID , etc , we can serve you over the counter . But you won't be able to use the ATM until your new PIN number arrives .
I see . Yes , that's fine . I'll be there at around 2:30 pm . See you later , and thanks .
Why , your price has soared . It ' s almost 25 % higher than last year ' s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price .
I ' m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere .
I ' m afraid I can ' t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ' Ve received from other sources .
But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ' s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries .
I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ' s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ' t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ' t changed much over the years .
There ' s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ' s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price .
Well , we ' ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ' ll have to try , I suppose .
I really have to go .
Why ? I still wanted to talk to you .
I have things to do .
Like what ?
Don't be nosey .
I'm not . I just want to know .
Well , it's really none of your business .
That's harsh .
I'm sorry , but I have to go .
Fine .
Thank you .
What ' s the time ? My watch has stopped .
It ' s half past twelve .
When do you have lunch ?
From one to two .
What do you normally eat ?
We usually go to the cafeteria .
Oh , it ' s time to have lunch now .
let ' s go together .
I would like to begin by introducing our foreign guests to our stuff on your left ( right ) , we have Mr . Brown , who is Vice President of Sales . Next to him is Ms . Arts , Director of Marketing for the Atlas Company . In the back row is Dr . Barolo , who is visiting from Italy . Thank you all for coming .
I am glad to see everyone is here and on time . Let's get started ! Susan , toss out some of your ideas .
I don ' t feel so good .
What doesn ' t feel right ?
I feel as if I am going to be sick to my stomach .
Perhaps you should get checked out at the Student Health Center before you go home .
I have some medicine at home that I could take .
Are you going to be OK to drive home , or would you like someone to go with you ?
Thank you , but my friend is in the library , and he can give me a ride home .
We hope that you are feeling better soon . E-mail me if you have any questions .
The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend .
So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ?
It sounds like it will be .
I really hope it doesn't get cold .
That would ruin things , I want to go so badly .
The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know .
That is true . The weather is constantly changing .
It would be nice if the weather would never change .
That would be great , then we could plan things sooner .
True . Predictable weather would make life easier .
I ' m not sure . Why don ' t you believe there is a god ?
I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one .
I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ' t explained yet .
I ' m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong .
For example ?
Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics .
Yes . Such people don ' t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs .
Thanks . I'm sorry to say that you need to get this stamped . There is no stamp on this slip and it is essential before I can process it for you .
I see . So , I need to stamp it . And sign it too ?
Yes , that's right . Down here , at the bottom right hand corner to show that you agree to pay the printed amount .
I'll go back to the office and get it sorted and pop back later . Thanks , bye for now .
There are cockroaches in my room .
Are you sure , sir ? Flies I could believe , but cockroaches ?
I've counted nine different cockroaches , and I accidentally stepped on another one .
Sir , we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel .
You dare to doubt me ?
I'm sorry , sir . Let me transfer you to my supervisor .
So you can't go with us , right ?
No .
Daddy , you always arrange your schedule so tight on weekdays . You should have a rest on weekends .
What park do you want to go to ?
Daniel wants to go to the aquarium . While Mom wants to visit the Summer Palace .
Haven't we been these places already ?
Yeah . I don't agree with them , but I don't have a better choice .
What about the Olympic park ?
Right , ah . It is so close to our home . How come we've never thought of that ?
The Olympic Park has a small forest . It is fit for picnic .
Very well , Go ahead .
Hum .. Can you recommend me one with high interest ?
OK . We offer a few different kinds of postal saving services . They have different interest rates .
I want the one with the highest interest rate .
That would be our Savers Plus account . You must pay 10 000 yuan into your deposit account . In this way you can get 5 % dividend at the end of the year .
All right . I'II open this one .
Just fill out these forms , and I ' ll be with you in one second .
Thanks .
Oh look ! What a great little bib for the baby ! This will definitely come in handy ! Oh wow , you also got me a stroller ! That ' s so great ! Thank you !
This next one is from Betty .
A highchair and car seat ! Wow Betty , thank you so much ! I really appreciate it !
One more from Carla .
A playpen and crib ! Thanks Carla ! This is just what I needed !
OK , that ' s all of them . No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ?
Umm . I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital !
I just got back from fighting the crowds .
You mean at the mall ? Was there a sale ?
Yeah . For five minutes , everything was half off . It was total chaos ...
Cool !
Grabbing , pushing and shoving ...
Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
Yes , it will print immediately .
How about next week ?
Fine , we'll be expecting you then .
I want the one with the highest interest rate .
That would be our Saver's Plus account .
4 . 5 % , that's good . How much money do I have to keep in it to get that rate ?
You have to maintain a balance of $ 10,000 in the account or the rate drops to 3 % .
All right . I ' ll open one of those .
Just fill out these forms , and I ' ll be with you in one second .
Thanks .
Could I try it on ?
Please do , the fitting-room is over there .
It feels a little tight around the waist . Do you have a bigger one ?
I'm sorry . We don't have this color in your size . We have some green ones in your size . Would you please have a look at this green one ?
OK . How much does it cost ?
It's 486 yuan .
When do you expect him back ?
I think he'll be back in about an hour at least .
Well , may I leave a message ?
Yes , of course .
Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ?
Ok . Does he know your number ?
I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 .
13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on .
Would you like something to drink ?
No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk .
So , you're a serious coffee drinker .
Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted .
Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing . Everyone has to have something . For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ?
No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker .
Well , what would you like to talk to me about ?
I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .
I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it .
It is about the staff meetings . You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday .
Yes .
Well , I have been thinking about it . And I believe we could do things more efficiently here .
What do you suggest ?
The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week . We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation .
You mean because people have to go across town to get here .
Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road .
That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them .
I think they are important too . That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them .
I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that .
Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more .
Well .
I also think the meetings should be more focused . And I would be willing to take responsibility for that .
You mean you want to run the meetings ?
No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting . This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .
Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks .
I really think it would work . The meetings could be longer , and better organized .
I am not against the idea , Arnold . It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do . Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works .
Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it .
I will call the managers . Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this " new style . "
Maybe sandalwood fan is good .
Would you show me some ?
Of course .
They really smell fragrant . How much is a real sandalwood fan ?
The small ones are one hundred yuan for each . And the big ones are two hundred and thirty yuan .
I'll take two small ones and a big one .
What else are you interested in ?
I'm afraid not .
OK . Here you are .
Yes . This is the computer and this is the keyboard and the monitor .
Is there anything else ?
There are a mouse and a camera .
Is that all ?
Yes . How much is it to send these things to Shanghai by regular delivery ?
It depends on the weight of these things . Generally speaking , we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram .
I see . Can you weigh them for me , please ?
Please go over there to weigh them .
OK . See you later .
Tell me your argument .
I was pulled over for allegedly speeding .
Are you sure you weren't speeding ?
To be honest , I really wasn't .
What speed were you going ?
I was under the speed limit . I was going 35 , when the speed limit was 40 .
I'm just going to let you go , since the arresting officer isn't here .
What about my ticket ? Do I still need to pay ?
Don't worry about it .
I'm so glad for your help .
He ' ll get used to it . They always do . I still remember when my daughter started . Are you going with him on his first day ?
You bet . I wouldn ' t miss it !
Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ?
Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out .
Friendship Hotel .
OK , it's not far from here .
I have something important to do , can you fast the speed ?
Sure , I'll try my best . Here we are .
How much should I pay you ?
The reading on the meter is 15 yuan .
Here's 20 yuan , keep the change .
Thank you very much .
why not ?
the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing !
it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking .
I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children .
I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking .
all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty .
perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow .
I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them .
that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad .
you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking .
Yes . I have a lot of experience in that . I have worked for the sales company as an assistant since finishing my university .
OK . It sounds fine .
Yes , but I still can not find it . Maybe it is in this cabinet .
I couldn't find the files you request , even though I checked all the cross-references . I don't think it's there .
I am sure that document was filed .
Well , let me check again under a different heading .
Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files .
Maybe that's why I couldn't find it . All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V ' .
How long will it take me to get there ?
It's about a ten-minute walk .
That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .
Not at all .
Do you want a furnished house or an unfurnished one ?
Furnished .
Very well . How long do you want the house ? All summer ?
No , not all summer . Just for six weeks .
I'm afraid I can only rent it for two months .
My holiday is only six weeks , but I think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks . Is the house in good condition ?
Yes , it is . It was just painted and it has all the modern conveniences .
You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ' t sleep well . What ' s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation .
Yes , I realise that . We've spent a long time planning and preparing for the change-over . I'm confident we won't have any major problems .
How long will the sub contractors be on site ?
About ten weeks in total if everything goes according to plan .
I'm sure it will . So , we should be able to start moving the machinery in during week 34 . I'll confirm that date with our suppliers .
How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ?
I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way .
You seem to be a kind-hearted lady .
Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature .
Please tell me your weaknesses if you can .
I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection .
Yes , you can have it delivered or filled at any location in our HMO .
When should I take this medication ?
You need to take it at bedtime .
Should I take this medicine on an empty stomach ?
Don ' t mix alcohol with this medication , but you can take it with or without food .
What are the side effects of this medication ?
You might feel a little dizzy at first , but it should pass .
Well , my car won't start . I don't know what's the matter with it .
Could it be the battery ?
No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago . It must be other problems .
Well , I suppose it could be the gas .
No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday .
Perhaps it's the starter then ?
Yes , that's possible .
Brunch ?
It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also .
Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch .
Ok . I ' ll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them . Where is the tea towel ? Oh , here it is .
We ' ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it .
While you ' re cleaning the cooker , I ' ll wipe the worktop . That was a great meat , by the way .
Actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it .
My pleasure ! This tea towel ' s a little ragged . Do you have another one ?
Yes . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out .
Keep it and use it as rag . You can clean your bicycle with it .
Sure . Here you are .
Just a moment , please . I'll draw up your bill for you ... Thank you for waiting , sir . Your bill totals two thousand six hundred and fifty-eight yuan , including the phone and laundry .
That much ! Would you mind letting me have a look at it ?
Not at all , sir . Here you are .
Thanks . Well , It seems to be right . How much is that in dollars , please ?
Just a moment , sir . I'll calculate that for you . It comes to 305 dollars and 52 cents at today's exchange rate .
I see . OK .
How would you like to make the payment ?
In cash , please . Here you are .
Thank you , sir ... Here is your change . Could you check it , please ? Thank you for choosing our hotel . I hope you enjoyed your stay .
By the way , please forward my mail to this address .
Certainly , sir . We hope you have a good trip .
By doing everything necessary and for further study .
How long would you like to stay with this company ?
How long I will stay with the company depends on whether the company and I are satisfied with each other .
What do you think of this industry's outlook in five years ?
I do believe this industry will be developed rapidly in 5 years time .
It ' s mostly on my right side . Right here !
Have you been feeling this way for awhile ?
I started feeling kind of sick last night after dinner , but this morning the pain got really bad !
Have you eaten anything unusual lately ?
No , not that I remember .
We are going to take you to an emergency room right now .
I will feel better when I know what the problem is . Thank you for the drugs .
OK , I can have it ready by the end of the week .
No , you don ' t understand , I need this tomorrow morning ! I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ' s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! She ' s gonna kill me !
OK , I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon , but this suit is also very stained . I can ' t guarantee we can remove it completely .
Fine ! Can you also iron and starch this shirt ?
Certainly .
Great ! This is our secret ! If you see my wife , say nothing to her about this !
Could you tell me how many kinds there are in your bank ?
Besides the checking account , there's a monthly savings account and a daily interest account .
Oh , I think I'd like to take the monthly savings account then .
Would you fill out this form ?
OK . Here you are .
All right . And here's your deposit book .
Thank you . Goodbye .
Goodbye .
The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train
Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ?
No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them .
My name's Donald Eakins .
How do you spell your last name , Mr . Eakins .
It's E-A-K-I-N-S .
E-A-K-I-N-S . First name , Donald . And what's your present address , Mr . Eakins ?
It's 1446 Pine Street .
1446 Pine . That's in San Francisco , isn't it ?
Yes , it is .
What is the reason for extension ?
I'll go into a practical training as soon as I receive my Master ' s degree from the University of Pennsylvania early next month .
We ' ll need a letter from your university and a financial statement from you .
That's where you'll find things like salt and pepper .
Oh , I see .
Let's go to aisle 4 to pick up some pasta for tonight .
Great ! Pasta for dinner .
And let's get a loaf of bread at the bakery for breakfast .
Maybe we should get a shopping cart .
I'll put the shopping basket back .
here's information about our competitor's recent market activities ...
Thanks , this will be a big help in putting together next quarter's marketing strategies . With competition this intense , we'll have to step up production even more . We need a price we can compete with .
We're in a very competitive environment . It's sink or saimin this market .
Better start swimming ! we've got to find a way to outsmart the other guys . I want a preliminarily strategic marketing plan on my desk by next Tuesday ... the competition never sleeps and neither should we .
Let me check ... His flight ' s at 2:30 p . m . , so he should leave no later than 12 noon .
Yes , we have plenty on hand right now .
Good , we'll take 500 suits .
OK , thanks for the order .
I am sorry . They are not available now .
Of course I remember you .
I think I lost my wallet here .
Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything .
Really ? You didn't find a wallet ?
No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ?
Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor . Has anyone sat at this table since we left ?
No . It's been empty the whole time .
Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened .
I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill . You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ?
No . My friend did .
Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ?
No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down . It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table .
Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home .
I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house . But what should I do ?
Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home . Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that .
Should I call the police ?
You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets .
Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home .
I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir .
Thanks for your help .
Could you deliver it tomorrow ?
No problem .
Please handle the items carefully .
Certainly .
We will pay by collect on delivery .
You wouldn't do that . Would you ?
I might . Vince knows he needs to keep me happy .
What about your accounts ?
Is this your first time flying ?
Yes . I'm going to San Francisco .
Oh , it's a beautiful city . I think you'll like it .
Hey , I'm feeling much better already .
Sometimes if you don't think about it , that sick feeling will go away on its own .
Thanks . By the way , my name is Mary .
I'm Frank . Nice to meet you .
I ' d like to buy a woolen vest for my grandpa .
I ' m sure you can find your favorite there .
Thank you very much .
It ' s my honor .
Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies .
Oh , we always go to the movies . Can't we do something different ?
Well , do you have any suggestions ?
Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ?
It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things .
Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
OK .
Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ?
At first I didn't know anything about the machine . Now I know how to operate it . Besides , the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement .
Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance .
Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job .
I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work .
OK , let's go .
We have an appointment in half an hour .
I see .
Do you have anything else I can have instead ?
Well , yes . How about beef stew ? We can serve you at once .
I'll take beef stew , then .
It's about a ten-minute walk .
That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .
Not at all .
You mustn't pick it in this place .
Where it is ?
It's a private garden .
Surely , of course . What kind of currency have you got ?
RIB .
How much would you like to change ?
1000 Yuan . Here you are .
Ok , thank you ! Where should I buy them ?
The pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic .
Great ! What floor is pharmacy on ?
The fourth . I'll send the prescription down there so you can just pick it up on your way out .
Thank you !
No , sir . Nothing except my personal belongings , such as clothes , notebooks and some gifts .
Any cigarettes or liquor ?
I have cigarettes for my own use .
I think you'll have to pay some duty on these cigarettes because they exceed the quota . And this article is liable for duty .
How much duty should I pay ?
One hundred dollars .
Here is the money .
Just a moment . I'll make out your duty memo . ( Writing and giving the memo to Mr . Green ) Take it and pay the girl over there .
Thank you .
Not just yet . I have one or two questions . How much for a single ?
During the peak season , a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night . But we ' Ve got a Single Super Saver Special going on right now -- only $ 30 a night . And we ' Ve also extended our checkout time 00 in
That ' s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients .
Yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . We can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . Of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking
That sounds great . Do you accept checks ?
I ' m sorry , sir , we don ' t . But we do accept all major credit cards .
Of course not , I appreciate that .
Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity .
I see . What can I do now ?
You can send a compressed one .
I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad .
Can I get you anything to drink ?
Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea .
Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
Thank you .
I'm attending a conference in Sydney this week . Remember ?
Oh , right . What time is it there ?
It's 10:00 P . M . And it's four o'clock in Los Angeles , right ?
Yes - four o'clock in the morning .
4:00 A . M . ? I'm really sorry .
That's OK . I'm awake now .
I wonder if there was an accident .
No , they just said it too many people were trying to get off at the Capitol exits .
Well , let ' s put on some music . We ' re going to be stuck in this for a while .
All right , what do you want to listen to ?
How about some Beatles ?
Yeah , all right .
This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ?
The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ' t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do .
And must I go back to school ?
No , you needn ' t do that . You ' d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes .
But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ' m nearly 17 .
You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ' t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study .
What else I ' Ve got to do ? Join the army ?
Who knows ! That might come to later .
Here you are .
Would you like a window or an aisle seat , Mr . Smith ?
I want an aisle seat as close to the exit door as possible , please .
Very well . Do you have any bags to check ?
No , I just have this one small bag .
Here you are , seat 12c . Please go to gate 23 after passing through the security checkpoint .
Thank you .
Have a nice day .
You , too .
( After they enter the park ) Oh , it's so quiet here . We have the park to ourselves , only you and me !
Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your left .
Oh , I see them . Some are doing Taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the Chinese Wushu .
A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China .
I want a single room with ocean view . Do you have one ?
Let me check . Yes .
OK . I will take it .
When do you check in ? How long are you planning to stay ? Do you have any special requirements ?
I guess I am going to arrive at 9:00 in the morning and I would like to leave at 200 in the afternoon on Sunday . Please give me a room away from the elevator . I hate noises while I am sleeping .
OK . No problem .
Excuse me . What are these charges ?
Oh , these are the phone charges and these are for something from the bar .
Wait a minute . I made a phone call , but I never made a connection .
I know , sir . Those aren't telephone company charges . Those are hotel charges .
Isn't that a bit excessive ?
I'm sorry , sir . It's our policy .
OK . Here is the money .
Thank you . Welcome to our hotel again .
It's already 3 8 o'clock .
Well , honey , wake up , or you'll be late for school .
OK .
No , but there is one downstairs , which my daughter used some years ago .
It sounds good . Could I go and see it myself ?
Certainly , you're welcome anytime .
See you later !
( after a while ) Good afternoon , Mrs . Smith . I called you just now .
Welcome ! Come in , please !
Yes .
This way please . Your room is upstairs ... Here it is .
Wonderful ! A modest , comfortable room . Ah , a beautiful window , through which I can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . How nice !
Yes , if you want to wash something , there is a separate lavatory room outside .
Excellent ! I like it ! When can I move in ?
Anytime you like .
OK .
Please show me your parcel order .
OK . Here you are .
Let me check your parcel number . Song Ping's parcel number should be CP 06230221 5 CN . Here is your parcel .
Thank you .
Not at all .
How long did the convulsion last ?
About 3 minutes .
Does he have any other complaints ?
Three days ago , he began to cough , sneeze and have a running nose . Yesterday , he began to have a fever .
Have you taken his temperature ?
It was 38 ° C this morning and it was 39 ° C just now .
Let me examine him to see if there is any rash . No rash .
Is it serious ? Is it meningitis ?
No , it is not meningitis . Just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection .
Does he have to be admitted to hospital ?
No . No need for admission . I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . Then I will give you a prescription . The pink tablets are used for his fever . When his temperature is over 38 ° C , give him one tablet . The other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions . The white liquid is for the cold . Give the baby plenty of water to drink .
Thank you very much , doctor .
We have nothing on sale today . But we're having a big sale next weekend .
Is the sale going to include dresses ?
Everything you can see will be on sale .
I like the sound of that . I'll just come back next weekend .
The savings will be worth the short wait . See you next weekend .
That ' s fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ?
He does . He ' s good at this genre too . It ' s a captivating read .
We ' re going to the bookshop . Would you like to join us ?
Yes , I would . I need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , I love browsing through the latest paperbacks .
Me too . I need something to read on the flight to New York . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ' s books for her daughter .
I want to look at nelson Mandela ' s autobiography .
This is sure to be a worthwhile read .
Yes . All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation .
I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices .
All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ?
How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan .
I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days .
I don ' t know . It was there when I woke up this morning .
It ' s rash . I ' d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ?
I bashed it against the chair in my room .
Does it hurt ?
A little , but not much .
Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ' ll take you to the doctor ' s after breakfast .
If I ' m better this afternoon , can I go to school ?
If you are better , but I doubt you will be .
Yeah , I got home around two .
Yes , that's right .
How long will you be staying ?
Three or four days , perhaps longer .
Very good , sir . We will be expecting you next Monday , the 12th .
What's so interesting about it ?
Well , this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up , half his face had been bitten off !
What ? How did that happen ?
They think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face .
Wow . What does his look like now ?
It looks pretty frightening . He doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . Most of his nose and chin are missing too .
What did he look like before his dog bit his face off ?
He was actually quite handsome . What a shame .
What's he going to do now ?
It said that he's hoping to get a face transplant , but until then , he's looking forward to Halloween so he isn't the only one wearing a mask .
Sure , it ' s Josh O ' Neil .
Ms . Stevens will be with you momentarily . Can I offer you something to drink ?
Yes , a coffee would be nice , thank you .
Here you are . Ms . Stevens is ready for you now . I ' ll show you to her office , right this way .
I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it .
Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ?
No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it !
You said you received your card this morning , am I right ?
Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ?
Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons .
Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me .
How did you spend the night there ?
We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful .
I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country .
Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't ?
Yes . It is one of the Five Mountains .
I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ?
I'd love to .
I ' m afraid not . It has to be a passport or a valid driver ' s license .
Oh ... wait a minute ... here ' s my driver ' s license .
OK , just fill in this application . You can sit over there . This brochure explains our services . We have free checking , and you will be given a debit card and on ATM card . There is no service
OK , I ' ll fill out the form and come right back .
What ' s the time ?
It ' s nearly half past seven .
My watch says ten past .
It ' s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight .
Are you sure half past seven ?
Positive . I ' ll put the radio on .
It ' s only seven o ' clock . Your watch is fast .
No , it isn ' t . It ' s stopped . I forgot to wind it up last night .
I could have stayed in bed for another half hour .
It's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against .
Holy cow ! I never heard of such a thing . How much do they cost ?
As a guest , sir , you pay nothing .
This sounds better every second . Now , when can I use the stations ?
If you want to swim , you can visit the gym any day between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m .
Oh , boy ! This is going to be great . I'm going to the gym right now !
I'm sure you'll enjoy your workout , sir . Everyone seems to like the swim stations .
You'd spend 30 % of your time on the computer . You may be bored with a job like that .
No problem . I am used to it .
I know what overbooked is , I just don ' t understand how that could happen ?
Actually it ' s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ' t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats ,
So who has to stay behind ?
Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone .
Ok . I ' ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket !
Why not ? I'd love to do that .
Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art .
Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ?
Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ?
I surely do . They must have had advanced machine in ancient China to do that .
No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .
Unbelievable ! I could never do that .
OK .
Thank you . Here is your tag .
Would you tell me the rate per day for depositing my bag ?
Sure , madam . Only one dollar .
When does the cloakroom close ?
This cloakroom is open until 10 p . m .
Oh , dear ! I won't be back until about 11:30 tonight . Where can I pick up my bag ?
We will transfer your bag to the Lobby Floor Cloakroom . You may collect it there , madam .
I see . Thanks a lot .
You're welcome .
Now let me check my schedule ... OK , you could to my office then .
Which would you like to remit , by mail or by cable ?
What is the difference between them ?
The cable will take less time for your account , in the meantime , the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one .
Well , I think the cable is better .
OK , please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary , your name and telephone .
All right . Here you are .
Everything is OK . The commission is 50 yuan .
Here you are . Thanks a lot .
Fine . And the charge is $ 100 .
When will it be available ?
Next Wednesday .
No problem . That happens to all of us , it goes badly with the traffic .
Thank you . Can I offer you some refreshment ?
Why not , thank you . A little tea would be nice .
Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ?
The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear .
I see , and what about the keyboard ?
I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work .
I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages .
Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways .
Oh , it was nothing . Anyone could have done it . I still have a lot to learn yet .
You are very modest . Best luck in your new position .
Thank you . I won ' t let this promotion change me .
No , early saturday morning .
We have a flight that we'll put you there at ten AM . Is that ok ?
Nothing earlier ? I prefer flight at nine thirty .
I'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight .
No , exactly not
How about afternoon ?
Sounds not good . I won't take it .
I am on a diet . And I do more exercise regularly .
What's the secret then ?
It lies in perseverance .
Well . It's hard for me . I can't keep doing exercise .
You should have a try .
For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .
So there isn't air in the glass boxes ?
No , there isn't . They are all vacuumed .
I wonder how old these things are , thousands of years ?
Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time .
Hey , look at the three-leg cup . I've seen it on TV .
The bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless !
Yeah , it has no value at all . Who will use this cup today ?
Danny , priceless means so valuable that you can't put a price on it .
Oh , it does ?
No . It ' s a pity about it .
Were you involved in any club activities at your university ?
Yes . I was a member of the basketball Society . I like playing basketball .
What extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ?
I sometimes played basketball and sometimes played football .
We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received .
That seems very impressive . Good work !
Thank you , but I cannot take all the credit . Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level .
Have you used any hotel services this morning or had breakfast at the hotel dining room , Mr . Green ?
Yes , my friend and I just had breakfast at the dining room , but we didn't use any services .
How about the charge for the days you shared the room with your friend ?
Please add to my account .
The total for the eight days is five hundred sixty yuan .
OK . Here you are .
I don ' t think he ' s back today .
Oh , that ' s right . Go ahead anyways . I ' ll fill him in . We can ' t lose this order under any circumstances !
I know , it ' s a big one .
So you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area .
Yes . It ' s quite troublesome .
Why not go and find a porter ?
Well , I don't know , but we can find out . We can talk to him and ask if he wants to join our group .
Firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . And secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . The last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age .
I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it .
Good luck to us .
Fine , madam . When will Mr . Brent be arriving , and how many nights will he be staying ?
What about this one ?
Oh , this is fine .
No . It's not far at all .
Thank you very much .
That's all right . Have a good day .
Certainly , Ms . Ransom . Do you have an order number ?
Is that right ?
I am a volunteer for this year ' s campaign .
That ' s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand .
I know history is about to be made , and I would like to be a part of it .
That ' s fantastic .
Are you planning on voting ?
I ' m going to vote .
Go to your polling place early on Election Day .
I will . Good luck with your volunteering .
That will work out fine . To make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ?
A dressy party would be fun !
That will work out fine . Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best ?
We should probably have both .
Yes , that will work out fine . Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ ?
Maybe we could do both !
Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details .
Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?
Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
Looks good ! I ' ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ' t forget the syrup !
Glad to meet you , Mr . White .
Miss Lu , have you got any experience in restaurant service ?
Yes . Since I entered college , I have been working at a fast food restaurant as a part-time waitress .
For how long ?
3 years .
Our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . Can you serve them in English ?
That's why I applied for this job . Now I am studying Hotel English in my college , and I am quite familiar with the western courtesy and restaurant etiquette . I am sure my public relation skills will leave a strong impression on your customers .
You must know our working hours are very long and overtime work is frequent .
I don't mind that .
I think I will give you a 3 months ' trial . The salary for this period is 800 yuan a month with no bonus . After that period if we both feel satisfied , a formal contract would be signed .
When am I supposed to start working ?
Next monday . Bring your resume and diploma with you .
Yes , I will . Thank you , Mr . White . Goodbye !
Goodbye !
Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ' t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful .
How do you think if I volunteer for some work ?
I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives .
I ' m free all afternoon . Why don ' t we meet at 1 o ' clock in the lobby ?
Great . We have a very pleasant working condition and I think we have a fine staff to work with .
Let me stop my car for check . Oh , my god . I got a flat tyre .
Can it keep going ?
Sorry . You'd better get off for taking another taxi .
I brought Strawberry Sticks . See ?
Those are the ones that are pre-dipped in sweet coating !
Yep . And there's real strawberry chunks in the coating .
Blackout ? Even the TV has the limit .
Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?
Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either !
That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ?
Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner !
OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here .
How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ?
Barbie ? You know , I might be seven , but I'm not a girl .
Do you have a better plan ?
All right , all right .
Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
ok , ok , how about we just go Dutch ? It's settled . Listen , I'm still pretty new around here , would it be alright if you found the restaurant ?
ok ... sure .
We decided that we could agree to your price , but we are a bit worried about the slow delivery .
Let me see . I quoted your delivery in three months , didn't I ?
Yes , but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible .
I thought you would be worried about it . So I rang Auckland last night . As you are our biggest customer , they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave Auckland next month .
Good , if you agree we'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then .
By all means .
Okay . I'm going to stay up a while . I've got to go over the household budget . We're a little overspent this month .
Please tell Tim to close the door to the basement . I don't want the dog down there tonight .
Okay . Good night . See you at breakfast .
Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I ' ll get it signed for you .
There is no way that I can fall asleep right now .
Try listening to some soft music .
It won't work . I'm nowhere close to being tired .
I really don't care , just go to sleep .
What if I stay up and do something , until I get tired ?
You'll be up all night if I let you do that .
I'm going to get to sleep eventually .
You need to go to sleep now , so go to sleep .
Good night .
Not really . There aren't any used bookcases listed . But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday . I think I'll go to them .
Do you mind if I go with you ?
Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
I learned to negotiate from my mother . I thought I was pretty good at bargaining , but I had a problem the other day at Kimble's Department Store .
What happened ?
I wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . It was priced at forty dollars , so I started by offering the salesclerk thirty .
What do you recommend ?
What about a green tea or perhaps a jasmine tea ?
What ' s this one ?
That ' s Oolong tea -- it ' s a Cantonese tea .
Ok , I ' ll try that .
I understand . Now , you're saying that you've already used up all your amenities ?
Oh , no ! I've got all I need for my stay here .
So , what's the problem ?
I need souvenirs !
You want some souvenirs !
Yes , yes . Souvenirs .
But , sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items .
That's not the same thing . If you buy hotel souvenirs , they have no sentimental value .
I understand , sir . I'll call housekeeping . You'll have your souvenirs shortly .
Size 41 . I want something in dark flannel .
How about this one ?
It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I'd like it better . This seems too light for winter . Do you think you could get me one ?
All right . I'll show you something darker . Do you like this one ?
It looks good . But can I try it on ?
Of course . Let me help you .
Thanks . It's comfortable . Well , how much is it , please ?
$ 280 .
Ok . I'll take it . Here's the money .
No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French .
Can you read and write English well ?
I can speak the language better than read and write .
Do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of English-speaking countries ?
I think so . I used to be an interpreter .
Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work ?
The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm .
You like my living room set , don't you ?
Where did you buy it ?
I found mine at IKEA .
Are they expensive ?
Everything I got from IKEA cost me a couple thousand .
Is the furniture crafted well ?
The furniture isn't built cheap .
I'll pay the money , as long as I'm getting what I pay for .
You will feel comfortable paying the money .
And your name , please ?
John Anderson .
Yes , sir . You're booked on Flight 201 , leaving in one hour .
Thank you .
Well , I ' m looking for size 10 but you don ' t have it .
How about this one ? I think it looks terrific on you .
Yes , I like the color . Can I try it on ?
Sure . The fitting room is on your right .
It fits well . I like it a lot . What do you think ?
You look pretty in red .
Oh , it ' s my favorite . How much is it ?
$ 29 . 99 .
Okay . I ' ll take it . Thank you very much for your help .
You ' re welcome .
No , I don ' t . I ' m a tourist .
Then you need to register as a new patient . Can I have a look at you ID card ? I need your name , age , occupation , address and contacting number .
Here you are .
Thanks . Which kind of medicine do you prefer , western medicine or traditional Chinese medicine ?
I ' d like to try traditional Chinese medicine . I heard it really works quite well if you know what you're doing .
All right . Yes , he does . The registration fee is 7 yuan , please .
Yeah , exactly ! I bought them last year . En ... at present , they are still in good state .
That's it ! All of them have first-class quality and performance . Besides , we adopt advanced technology . Now we have developed new products . They are much better than what you have bought .
Your company is developing so fast . Maybe later on I will plan to buy more .
That's great ! Thanks for your support . If any , please remember to call us . I am afraid I have to say goodbye now ! Bye , Mr . James !
Bye !
Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ?
There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table .
The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ?
You know , that is one of my favorites !
OK , I'll take one order of that .
You could choose another appetizer for half price to share .
Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings .
Of course not . What exactly would you like to know ?
First , what is the number for room service ?
It's 1200 . Room service is available 24 hours a day .
Very good . Now , could you help me to adjust the air conditioning , please ? It's too hot in my room .
Yes , the control unit is on the wall next to the bathroom . Is 24 ° C all right ?
Yes , that's perfect . Another thing , if need more items for the mini-bar , which Number should I call ?
You should call the Housekeeping Department on 2300 . They will replace any stock for you immediately .
I see . So , is it possible to make international phone calls from my room ?
That's no problem . Just dial 9 to get an outside line , and then dial the number as usual .
Well , thanks a lot for your help .
No problem , sir . If there's anything else you need , you can find me at the desk by the elevator , or you can call housekeeping if I'm not there .
OK , goodbye .
Goodbye , sir .
No , thank you . I can manage it , I think .
We haven't decided yet , we will let you know if we do .
OK . Thank you . Where should I buy them ?
The pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic .
Great . What floor is the pharmacy on ?
The fourth . I ' ll send the prescription down there , so you can just pick it up on your way out .
Thank you .
There are several , take a piece . The crash appears in the headline . It is famous for offering catastrophe stories .
I have a long flight for ten hours . I need to choose a magazine .
There are various magazines in the rack .
Give me the latest issue of ' National Geographic ' .
That's the top magazine in America and is popular with young people . OK . It is totally 30 dollars .
Here you are .
Have a nice trip .
Oh , Okay .
No , I haven ' t had a cold . I just have a heavy feeling in my chest when I try to breathe .
Do you have any allergies that you know of ?
No , I don ' t have any allergies that I know of .
Does this happen all the time or mostly when you are active ?
It happens a lot when I work out .
I am going to send you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma .
Thank you for your help , doctor .
No ! He hit me first .
I don't care . You know better than to hit him . Go sit on your bed for 10 minutes .

SAY 201 .
All right , Madam . I'll have a tow truck there within 30 minutes .
That's fine . We've allowed forty-eight hours to be on the safe side .
Mm , yeah , that ' ll be great . Tell him I ' ll see him then .
That ' s right . If you have hot dishes , you can try some .
It might be too hot for me .
And there are Cantonese cuisine and Kiangsu cuisine .. Most people like them .
What about any special Beijing dishes ?
There ' re Beijing roast duck .
OH , yes . I heard of a lot of about it . I like very much to try it . Where can I find it ?
You can find it in most restaurant . The best place certainly is Quanjude restaurant .
Is it near here ?
Not too near but not too far either . A taxi will take you there in fifteen minutes . the traffic is not too bad , I mean .
Well , thank you for your information . What ' s the name of that restaurant again ?
Let me write it down on a piece of paper for you . You can show to the taxi driver .
That ' s very kind of you . Thanks a lot .
I think he will come back at 3 p . m . Do you want to call later ? Or would you like to leave a message for him ?
I'd like to leave a message . Please ask him to call me back as soon as he returns . I'm A and he has my number .
OK . I will do that .
Thank you very much . Bye .
You're welcome . Bye .
OK . Give me one , please .
Here it is .
Thank you .
I'm always at your service .
Mom , just ten more minutes . The show is going to be over soon .
Peter , if you don't do it soon , I will throw your toys in the trash can .
I have ten years marketing experience . This includes both entry level and management positions . In my last position , I worked my way up to being director of the marking department .
I can see that from your resume . Your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company , is that right ? Later , why did you decide to leave your former post ?
I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new .
I see . Do you want to work full-time or part-time ?
I would rather work full-time .
I'll make note of that . Now , what are your salary expectations ?
I am willing to negotiate , but I expect at least $ 40,000 a year .
Give me one coke , please .
Is this to go or to eat here ?
To go , please .
That comes to four dollars and ten cents .
And can I have some ketchup , please ?
It's on the service counter over there . Please go to help yourself .
Thank you very much .
I need another savings account .
Do you have another account with us ?
I sure do .
Would you like to transfer money from that account into your new one ?
That ' s fine .
How much would you like to transfer ?
Transfer $ 100 .
Give me a moment while I complete your transaction .
That ' s fine . Thank you .
Yes , the officer is here today .
What's your case ?
I was pulled over for running a red light , but I never did .
Do you believe that the officer lied ?
There was a camera on the signal . So , he was obviously lying .
Your license plate was caught on camera ?
A picture of my license plate was never taken .
Since there is no picture of your license plate on record , I'm going to let you go .
Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me .
More and more people easily get irritated while driving .
Yes . This is what is called road rage .
I went to Macy's and picked it out .
I love your outfit right now .
Well , I think you look nice today too .
Thanks . I found these new shoes earlier at the store .
I think that those are some really nice shoes . What kind are they ?
These are Chucks .
Your shoes look really nice . How much did you get them for ?
They only cost me about forty dollars .
I'm going to go get a pair for myself .
All right . Just wait a minute , OK ?
Which flight do you want to change ?
The next one to my destination . I have to be there as soon as possible .
Which room are you in ?
1808 . The toilet doesn ' t work properly ; the water doesn ' t run in the shower .
I ' m awfully sorry to hear that . I ' ll turn to it right away .
but i can see you dance wonderfully well .
thanks for flattering me .  i think you dance much right ?
no , just occasionally
oh , i like this music very much , let's tango .
i'm afraid i can't dance well .
This is very annoying .
I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course .
No , I don't risk it .
How about a delicious dessert then , with our compliment ?
I'm not keen on dessert as a habit . They are fattening .
I see , sir . I'm sure everything will be right next time you come .
Sir , leave the house if the fire draws any closer to your house . Our men will be over in 5 minutes .
I always drink too much wine in the evening .
You shan't drink more wine in the evening .
Yes , you are right .
And you'd take some exercise every day .
Many thanks for your advice .
You mean at the mall ? Was there a sale ?
Yeah . For five minutes , everything was half off . It was total chaos ...
Cool !
Grabbing , pushing and shoving ...
Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ?
Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate .
I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ?
Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu .
Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today .
Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon , too . You ' Ve been doing some great work !
Really ? I have been there several times .
Are there many employers ?
Yes . The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers .
So there will be many large companies in the personnel market , right ?
Yes , there are many famous corporations .
When will there be a job fair ?
Every Saturday and Sunday
Do I need to pay to go into the personnel market ?
No , it's free .
How about going there to have a look now ?
OK , let's go .
Once the US economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack , the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world .
What challenges is your country's economy facing at the moment ?
We do face a lot of challenges because there is still much uncertainty about the world economy . It's very important for us to strike a proper balance between investment in fixed assets and household consumption .
Really ? I am too happy .
I've been reviewing your work over the past few months . Thanks to your excellent work , we benefit much from your project . And you should get the perfect attendance award too .
Thanks for your trust . Owing to my colleagues ' help , I've successfully completed my task .
You are very modest and diligent . The distribution of bonus derived from the performance evaluation . You deserve it .
Thank you very much . I will redouble my efforts in the future .
No , thanks a lot . I'll try it myself .
That's good . We eat Chinese food only at the Chinese restaurant .
My mother can make some Chinese food .
Really ? That's wonderful !
No . Do we need tickets ?
Well , probably . Probably you will have to wait in line if you don't have tickets .
Outside or inside ?
Outside , on the sidewalk .
Hmm . It's very cold today . But I brought my jacket . Maybe it will be alright to wait .
The MYOMA is very popular . There will be a lot of people .
MYOMA ? What's that ?
Oh , sorry . It stands for the Museum of Modern Art . It's an acronym . M O M A MYOMA .
I see . Do you have any suggestions for other things we should do ?
I suggest you go to the Jewish Museum . It ' s not far from the Guggenheim , near Central Park . It is really very interesting . Also , there is a great museum of medieval European art further up north . It ' s called the Cloisters .
How can we get up there ?
You can take a bus .
But Larry says the neighborhoods in the north are dangerous .
Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area .
I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
How much do you think the rent will be ?
I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
No problem .
That's OK . If you want the photo I will mail it to you .
No need , sir .
Which do you prefer , color or black and white ?
The last one is black and white , all the rest should need color .
OK .
I hope they will come out well . When should I pick them up ?
They will be ready at noon tomorrow . Each negative develops one print , right ?
Yes , it is . And develop them as glossy as possible .
No problem . Do you need another film ?
Yes , a roll of Kodak film please .
It is totally $ 20 including the deposit for films .
Thank you .
as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health .
I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse
what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?
it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .
I see , so it's similar to global warming ?
they're related to one another , yes .
I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .
people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .
people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .
I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place .
We need to find a good realtor .
Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .
What do you mean ?
Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .
But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .
Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .
I still think we should have a realtor . We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has
Of course we need a home inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .
So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?
It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .
And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?
Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .
Why ?
Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .
Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .
It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .
I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .
Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store .
E-commerce , or Electronic Commerce is the practice of purchasing and selling products or services over the Internet .
What kinds of channels can you use in e-commerce ?
We can complete a trade by email , electronic data interchange and smart cards , and so on .
What are the benefits of e-commerce ?
Firstly , it can overcome the geographic limitation . And secondly , e-commerce can lower the internal costs . And thirdly , people like us , can also open stores on Internet .
How things have changed now !
I told you we should have stayed in town today . The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow . Why did you want to come up here ?
I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .
Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?
I don't know .
I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .
What do you mean ?
We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time . We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .
I have plenty of gas .
Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working . We can't just let the car run and run . If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .
So what can we do ?
Turn the lights off . Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . That will conserve the heat as long as possible .
Alright . That's a good idea .
I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .
Days ?
Yes , it happens . That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .
Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .
Probably we'll survive . But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .
I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 150,000 a year . To be honest , I left the company to get more income .
You'll see one at the corner on your right .
Last time I lent you money , you never paid me back .
I promise if you lend me five dollars today , I will repay you in full next week .
Ok , but I'm taking your skateboard as collateral .
Fine ! I can't believe you don't trust me .
It's nothing personal , just business .
OK , thank you very much .
Not at all . That's what I should do .
I like that Kenmore refrigerator .
This particular refrigerator is a very good choice .
Tell me about it .
Not only is it affordable , but it comes with all the appliances .
What are the appliances .
It has an ice maker , water dispenser , and plenty of room on the inside .
I'd like to see it for myself .
Go right ahead .
I like what I see .
It comes on the dot .
Does it occur seasonally or all year round ?
It has been seasonal during these past three years .
Are you sensitive to other things ?
Yes , things like seafood and penicillin-type drugs .
OK . Let me examine your nose . According to your case history and the examination , I believe that it's allergic rhinitis .
What useful treatment can you offer ?
I'll give you a series of specific skin tests . Then we'll know exactly what substances you're allergic to . Then I'll give you some causes of desensitization therapy .
Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch !
But you bought it only last month .
Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired .
How long will it take us to get there ?
I think about ten minutes by bus .
It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain .
Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus .
I think he'll be back in about an hour at least .
Well , may I leave a message ?
Yes , of course .
Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ?
Ok . Does he know your number ?
I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 .
13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on .
Yes , he used to be . But now he ' s drifting off track .
He must have been in bad company , or he wouldn ' t be off the beans .
Don't worry , he'll make good progress step by step .
Here's a form to get you started .
My old card is perfect , so all I want you to do is copy it exactly .
I think you'll be very pleased with how well we duplicate your old card .
... Here you go
Thanks . Come back here next Wednesday to pick up your order , please .
I'm sorry , but can you give me a three-day turnaround ?
If you don't mind paying a little extra , it's absolutely no problem .
I told him that I hadn ' t got a raise for three years . I also told him that one of my best co-workers quitted her job because she had not been promoted for eight years .
Did he want to know the reasons ?
Yes . I told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession . But I thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only .
That ' s sex discrimination . When will you get the reply ?
In a couple of days , I was told .
Wish you good luck !
Thank you .
I'm here on vacation .
Oh , I hope it be fixed on Friday .
45 yuan ? It is too much , Are you sure ?
It is 45 yuan on the meter .
Is there something wrong with your meter ?
No . I am sure about that .
OK . Could you give me a receipt ?
Yes . This is your receipt .
Oh wow ! Thanks a million , Angie !
It looks so cute . Is it a parrot ?
Yes . Just look at her colorful feathers . What else can it be ?
I see . It's interesting that there is also a parrot in my English book . His mane is Polly .
Really ? A foreign parrot !
He can speak English , too .
Maybe you can teach Lulu some English words .
Lulu . Lulu . Say hello . hello . Oh , she is so smart . Good bird .
I need to see if we can get together today .
I am very grateful to your help .
Don't mention it . It is my duty .
Thanks again .
To be frank , you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country . I'd like to know some ideas of terms on which you would be willing to operate as our agent .
As we are a well-established company , we are very familiar with the customers ' needs . Besides , we can make full use of our good connections with the wholesalers and retailers here and develop a good market for your products if appointed as your agent .
Sounds reasonable . I will tell my boss about you agent application . Another question , what do you think is the minimum annual sales you can guarantee ?
To be on the safe side , and for garment of all materials , sizes , and styles , I think the amount will be 50,000 pieces a year .
Well . As our sole agency , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own .
No , certainly not .
In about twenty minutes .
Really ? What's that ?
Everything for summer is 20 % off .
I like this T-shirt . Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with it ?
Sure . We have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the T-shirt . Look at this section .
This one is good .
You have good taste . It is very much in style this year .
I'll take this one . How much are they ?
160 yuan .
Here you are .
No , I ' m afraid not .
Well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . Besides , you should let old people on first .
Sorry .
It ' s all right . Where are you going ?
I wanted to see the White House .
Oh , well you don ' t want this bus , anyway . It goes to Georgetown .
Oh , no .
It ' s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A .
Oh , well thank you very much .
You ' re welcome .
6 hours . If you are in a hurry we can develop it in 3 hours .
There is no need . I will come back tomorrow .
I surely will . How much is this wood carving ?
You are an expert on it . That wood carving is very rare . But I'm so sorry . that is not for sell .
That's OK . Is anything else recommended ?
Do you have any special request ?
I'd like to see some traditional arts .
So that means you are shopping for presents ?
Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends .
Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle .
Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut .
I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best .
You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale .
As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country .
Wow , you are the expert on it .
What kind of teaching certificate do you have ?
I have a TEFL certificate .
How many years of experience do you have ?
I have three years of teaching ESL and four years of teaching per-school children .
When did you get your TEFL certificate ?
I got my TEFL certificate three years ago .
Why do you want to teach at our school ?
Well , I ' Ve heard many good things about it . I also like teaching young children .
That ' s great . Can you speak Chinese ?
Yes , just a little .
Can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10:00 ?
I sure can .
Great . See you then .
Um ... we never were . We're just friends .
Well , if you're not seeing anyone , maybe we could ...
... I am seeing someone . This is Yi-jun , my ...
Ok .
This is really wonderful party .
Yes , you are always popular with everyone . and you look very pretty today .
Thanks , that's very kind of you to say . I hope my necklace goes with my dress , and they both make me look good I feel .
You look great , you are absolutely glowing .
Thanks , this is a fine party . We should have a drink together to celebrate your birthday
Let's go under the tree .
No , we can't . It's thundering .
Then let's go to that store .
Right , if you see the bookshop , you can see the hospital .
Thank you for your help .
Not at all .
I am sorry the larger ones are out of stock now . But you might be lucky at our Branch .
Wow , let me try . It tastes nice . How did you make it ?
It ' s as easy as pie . I always follow recipes .
For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share .
Don't you think you would miss having other people around ?
No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy
If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ?
That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like
Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?
I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children !
Where will you live during the vacation .
In the hotel .
Have you made a reservation ?
Yes , we have .
That's OK .
It started yesterday . I didn't eat any supper .
Have you got a temperature ?
I think so . I feel very hot .
Let's see . Yes . You ' Ve got quite a high temperature .
I've got an awful headache , too , and my throat hurts .
Hm ... I think you ' Ve got the flu .
Is it serious ?
No , not at all , but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine .
How often must I take it ?
Three times a day after meals .
Thank you , Doctor . Goodbye .
Oh , very nice . How long will you be in Beijing ?
Probably another week .
Oh , I see . Well , I ' ll give you my phone number and if you need a guide , please call me .
Thank you very much . That ' s very kind .
I've got a backache .
Do you often suffer from backache ?
No , I don't . I've never had a bad one before .
When did it start ?
About four days ago .
Well , go home and rest in bed for two days , then you'll feel better .
Can you give me some medicine ? It's very painful .
Yes , I'll give you some pills . Take one a time and three times a day , and come back in three days . If you don't feel ...
Yes .
I ' d like to know more about it .
Can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o ' clock ?
OK . I will be there .
Thank you for calling . Goodbye .
Bye .
Hi , Linda , I'm just calling to invite you to a dinner party tomorrow evening .
Really ? What time and where ?
7:30 PM at London-Chinese restaurant . I \ ' ll be at your place at seven to pick you up if you need a ride .
Yes , please , I'll need a ride . I'll be waiting for you then .
See you tomorrow at seven . Make sure your dress a little formally . I heard the restaurant is kind of upscale .
Thank you , see you then .
See you .
Great . Can I take it with me now ? Or do you need me to fill in some forms or something ?
No , you can take it away now . I just need you to sign here .
Here you are .
Just one thing before you go , could you please prepare your documents in accordance with the L / C within the validity period ?
No problem , I'll get on that right away . Thanks , bye .
Thank you so much .
I have to say , I have had enough of this roller coaster .
I know what you mean . I'm like a yo-yo .
Last week I was down to 60 kilos . This week I had one donut more . Now I'm up to 62 kilos .
No , thanks , I ' ll come back later . May I reserve a table for two ?
Yes , of course . May I have your name , sir ?
Bruce By the way , can we have a table by the window ?
we ' ll try to arrange it , but I can ' t guarantee sir .
That ' s fine .
your table's ready , sir ? Please step this way .
Yes . They usually do it .
Do they charge for that ?
Of course . In Europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service .
Is it the same in America ?
They do the work without charge to the importer .
It's part of their service , isn't it ?
Exactly .
Is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ?
No , you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment .
I see . By the way , how do we prove the ownership of our goods ?
You must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice .
I see . Thank you .
You are welcome .
No , not really . But I think it should be something distinctively Chinese . And easy to carry .
I would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik . They are very easy to carry .
So , we'd like to see some embroidery .
About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ' d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive .
Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time !
Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers .
Great ! I ' ll take it .
Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train !
I understand . Thank you very much !
Have a great trip .
Yes , sir , it is .
Thank you , the service was good
Please come again .
I know , I know . But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world !
Really ? What's the series about ?
Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it .
It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth .
I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results .
Really ? that's interesting !
Yeah . Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good .
OK , I'll give it a go .
I ' m not available tomorrow afternoon . How about tomorrow morning ?
I ' m sorry . Dr . Galas is fully engaged tomorrow morning . How about the day after tomorrow at 9:30 in the morning ?
That ' s fine . Thanks .
You ' re welcome . Could I have your name and phone number , please ?
Certainly . My name is Janet Smith , and my phone number is 610-555-1234 .
Very good , Ms . Smith . I have scheduled an appointment for you on Wednesday at 9:30 am .
Thank you very much .
You ' re welcome .
So , what do we do now ?
This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords .
Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ' ll deposit one month ' s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ' s rent in advance . I understand that I ' ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs .
Yes . If you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out .
Can I pay you by check ?
Sure . A check will be fine .
Is there a laundry room in the basement ?
Yes .
Can I sign the lease right now ?
Take the same number bus going other direction . There ' s stop right cross the street .
Thank you .
OK . Let's do it .
Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice .
I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not .
Well , it looks like you have . You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out . Can you just refill it once more ?
I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription . And this prescription has run out .
But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription .
Miss , I understand your problem . But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it . We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never .
But I have a prescription . I just need more of it .
A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law . You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor . It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens . But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry .
This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it .
Maybe that's true . I don't know . But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too .
I am looking for a growth opportunity , which I feel is not available at my current employer . In terms of skills , I am Microsoft certified in Windows XP and several other operating system
Where do you see yourself five years from now ?
I see myself in a management position .
What're you talking about ? My alarm even hasn't gone off yet .
Yes , it did . It went off thirty minutes ago . You slept right through it . You're like a dead person while you sleep .
I must have slept right through it .
Rise and shine ! Sleepyhead !
Just let me sleep five more minutes .
The early bird gets the worm .
I know , I know . But I don't want any worms .
Ha ! Ha ! If you don't make an effort now , later on it'll be a lot tougher for you .
Not bad .
I always have the temptation to eat something there .
Then , why didn't you do that ?
I don't know how much we can trust them . Do you have any ideas ?
Some of them , I think , are not good .
It doesn't taste good ?
No , I mean some of them are not clean enough .
That's my greatest concern . But how can you tell which one is clean ?
I judge by appearances .
I got it . I think it's worth trying .
It certainly is .
I'd like to try some kebab , roasted squid , and many different appealing things .
Don't try everything at one time , please .
I see . Thank you .
Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ?
Alright . Maybe it's the only way to do it .
Yeah ! I just started my training today and I ' m not really sure where to begin .
It ' s ok , I know how it is . This machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ?
Well , I don ' t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio .
In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ' s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ' s a lot of weight !
It ' s not that much . Just watch ... I ' m ok ...
Ours are of really good quality .
I see , please wrap it .
It's very pleasant .
What's the weather like in spring ?
It's often windy in March . It's always warm in April and May , but it rains sometimes .
What's it like in summer ?
It's always hot in June , July and August . The sun shines every day .
Is it cold or warm in autumn ?
It's always warm in September and October . It's often cold in November and it rains sometimes .
Is it very cold in winter ?
It's often cold in December , January and February . It snows sometimes .
Is there any flexibility on that ?
Unfortunately , not .
OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan .
Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away .
Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy .
You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
But I don ' t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .
I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
Are you in a hurry ?
Yes , I have to be there to meet a friend at 5 thirty pm . So we're sure we can get there on time ?
I'm afraid not , sir . Generally we can , but you know how it is in the rush hour now .
I see . Here's the extra 5 $ for you if you can get me there on time .
All right . I'll do my best .
Oh . we made it . Thank you . How much do I own you ?
The reading on the kilometer is 12 $ .
Here's the money , keep the changes , please .
Do you need a receipt ?
No , thank you .
I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 120,000 Yuan per year .
That's a little more than we had planned .
I think you'll find I'm worth that .
I can only offer you 110,000 Yuan a year . Raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance . Is that satisfactory ?
Yes , it is quite reasonable .
Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .
Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
What do you drink ?
Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
What do you drink ?
What do you mean ?
This will be my first time using an ATM .
I can help you with that .
Explain to me how to use it .
Just put your card into the machine .
Now what do I do ?
Then you need to type in your PIN .
Now what ?
Just click on one of the choices they give you , and that ' s it .
It's $ 4 . 25 cents by the glass . The whole bottle is $ 22 . 5 .
I'd like a bottle please .
I'll need to see your ID please .
Here you go .
Sorry about the inconvenience , you look so young . I had make sure you are over 21 years old .
The 17th will be fine .
And what date will you be returning ?
Hmm , I guess on the 28th .
Okay , you ' re booked on American Airlines flight 710 , departing JFK at 6:40 p . m . on September 17th . Your return flight is flight 711 , departing London ' s Heathrow Airport at 11:15 a . m . on September 28th .
Sounds good . Thanks a lot .
All right , sir . They should be ready for you by tomorrow afternoon .
Thank you very much .
It's our pleasure .
But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency .
I doubt that .
It's a Chevrolet . Why do you ask ? You going into the car business ?
Nothing like that . My cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him , so he's going to sell it - cheap . It's practically new .
well I have been thinking about getting a newer car . I can't afford a brand new one .
Would you like to look at my cousin's car ?
Is it a four-door or a two-door ?
It's a coupe with a vinyl roof .
Does it have automatic transmission ? .
Yes , and it also has power steering , power brakes , and air conditioning .
I guess I might take a look at it .
Oh , I've never seen a better Mexican restaurant .
Thank you , sir .
Your name and examination number , please .
My name is Du Tao , number 3 .
Pardon ?
Du Tao . D-U for Du and T-A - 0 for Tao .
Yes , Mr . Du , when were you born ?
I was born on January 1st , 1988 . I ' m 20 years old now .
Where do you live ?
I ' m living at Room 222 , Building 18 , N . P . U .
Can you leave me your phone number ?
Gladly , 8962105 2 .
Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .
It always hurts . I hate going .
Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
O . K . , O . K . , I ' ll go .
Good . You feel better after you do .
Well , it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it .
I see . You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ?
That's right . You should give it up , too . It ' s bad for your health .
Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying .
But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started . Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip !
What do you mean ? What are you talking about ?
I mean you couldn't give it up !
You are kidding . What happened ?
Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce .
That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ?
Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out .
That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ?
Early in the New Year I guess .
Sure , for at least three thousand per month .
That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for .
I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent .
Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? It won ' t take more than a half hour , will it ?
That's long leave . How's your project coming along ?
The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on .
Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave .
Thank you , Mr . Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr . Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients .
Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed .
I will . Many thanks , Mr . Black .
You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ?
Sounds good . May I have a look ?
Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on .
They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs .
All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality .
Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ?
This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac .
Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones .
OK , I will wrap them for you .
You seem to have picked up some kind of infection .
What should I do ?
Take a few days off from work and don't wear yourself out .
You have quite a range , haven't you ? I would like to see some other styles .
Yeah , that ' ll be great . I ' m on extension 4283 .
What a shame ! I didn't see them .
Well , can you help me look for it ? That's my first time here .
Sure . It's my pleasure . I'd like to help you look for the missing keys .
It's very kind of you .
It's not a big deal . Hey , I found them .
Oh , thank God ! I don't know how to thank you , guys .
You're welcome .
All right . Shall I enter all my belongings ?
No , only the articles listed on the Declaration .
Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony .
Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration .
I want to prove my true value in the electronic industry , and hopefully in the near future I would be promoted to a higher position .
Well , thank you for coming . We ' ll let you know as soon as possible .
No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go .
Does it taste good ?
Sure . It's a popular dish among young ladies .
I think I'll try it .
We have three kinds of dressings for salad . Italian , French and Thousand Island . Which one would you like ?
French , please .
OK . Do you want to order something else ?
Milan Style Macaroni . Don't put sugar or salt on it , please .
Let me check ... yes , we got the October issue a few days ago . It's on that shelf over there .
Okay , I'll take these two magazines and a copy of Today's Post .
Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door ?
OK . I will .
I'll have our housekeeper come right away .
I'm sorry I was too tired to fall asleep .
When you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub .
Right . Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ?
A . This is George .
Hello , George . What ' s up ?
I see . It feels very light on the skin .
It gives your skin a very natural healthy look .
I like the cool smell , too .
All right .
Lincoln . That's L-I-N-C-O-L-N . Thank you .
I have to be there before 17 o'clock .
We'll make it except a jam . You know it's rush hour .
There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
I'll do my best .
Here's twenty dollars .
Do you have small bills ?
No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ?
Here is your receipt . Thank you .
Certainly . Go along Queen's Road ...
Along Queen's Road ...
Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel .
Right at the Hilton .
Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral .
The Cathedral ?
Yes . Then cross the road at the next traffic lights . The Peak Tram is straight ahead . You can't miss it .
That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ?
Yes . Why ?
Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down .
That would be great .
When do you want it delivered ?
I need it delivered tomorrow . Will that be possible ?
What time exactly ?
I need it delivered at 12 o'clock .
We can have it to you at that time .
That's not a problem ?
We will deliver your mattress tomorrow at 12 o'clock .
That's great ! Thank you very much .
Come over here . I will test your eyes . First cover your left eye like this , and when I point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can , telling me which way the " E " points .
All right .
Good . Now the other eye .
Well , this one is worse .
Never mind , just read as far as you can .
I can only read the first three lines .
If one's available , please . But not over the wing .
I'm sorry . If you look at the ad again , you'll see that the other brand is on sale .
Oh . You're right . I misread the ad .
Yes , many people make that mistake .
Well , you can't blame them . It's a confusing ad .
You're right . Many ads are like that .
Well , as long as I'm here .
Just one second , and I'll give you the batteries that are on sale .
Great . I forgot to ask you , though . How long did you want the place ?
Six months .
Oh , well , that might be a problem . I usually only sign one year leases .
Well , one year would be fine , too . I ' m not planning on leaving the area anytime soon .
Well , if it ' s not a problem . Then here you go .
Just let me look at it quickly .
Of course .
Looks like a standard lease .
Yeah , and don ' t worry about the security deposit . If everything ' s all right when you move out , you ' ll get it back .
O . K . Great . Just sign and date it here ?
Yes . Thanks . You can move your stuff in tomorrow .
Wonderful .
Yes , it is .
That's fine . Let's get on the bus .
Yes , sir . Your balance is RIB 34,000 .
I ' m thinking about buying this sweater . I know it ' s June now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
It looks too big for you , but I like the color and the material is good quality . Is it on sale ?
Yes , it ' s half price . It ' s supposed to be too large--that ' s the fashion .
I might get one too , but in a different color . I prefer light blue to white .
There . It looks great , don ' t you think ? I ' m going to get these jeans as well . I need a new pair . I ' m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter .
I ' m getting this beret ? Doesn ' t it look cool ? I ' d like to get some jeans too , but I don ' t have enough cash on me .
Don ' t worry . I ' Ve got my credit card . You can pay me back later .
Thanks ! Now I don ' t need to come back to the shop a second time .
We will inform you as soon as possible .
You ' re welcome .
I understand .
Right ? OK , got it .
Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ?
Next left then right ? OK .
Wait a second , PLS . Yes , Mr . Lee , we have a room reserved for you . How long do you plan to stay ?
Probably two days . My wife will join me tomorrow . Then we will decide when to leave for Seattle .
Would you sign the register , PLS ?
By the way , does my room have a private bath ?
Certainly , every room in this hotel has a private bath .
Does my room have twin beds or a double ? I prefer a room with twin beds .
Your room has twin beds , Mr . Lee . It also has a view . I am sure you will like it . This is your key . It's on the eighth floor room 801 . The elevator's over there .
Thank you . One more thing , where is your restaurant ?
The restaurant is on the second floor . We also have a cafeteria on the top floor . If you would like something to drink , you can either call room service or come down here . The bar is right behind the lobby .
Thank you , you are very kind !
You are welcome !
Right . We do the same thing at home . Don't you remember ?
Oh yeah . The big napkin goes on my lap .
Let's look at our menus .
Cindy , help me order because I'm still not very familiar with American cooking .
Well , we order appetizers first and then entrees .
How much would it be ?
From 200 to 800 .
I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ?
No problem .
Go and try it on .
What do you think ?
I love that shirt on you .
What about the jeans ?
They don't really fit you right .
I don't think so either .
That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though .
Well , I'll just buy the shirt .
That would be a good idea .
Mr . J . Smith .
Where would you like him to come ?
To the front desk .
Just a moment , please .
Are you serious ?
Yes , I am really excited .
That's great . Congratulations .
I appreciate that .
You have no idea how happy I am for you .
For real ?
I believe you were the best choice for that promotion . I really do .
Sure .
Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here .
Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ?
Demographics say an average age of 28 . 7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year .
All right .
Oh , I like the music on your radio . It's nice .
Thank you ! I always tune to this program when driving . So what's your favorite program ?
I like Winner's English very mush . You know the Beijing Olympic Games is right around the corner . We should learn English Well . It's on FM 96 . 6 , China Business Radio . You can get it on your radio too .
But I don't speak English at all .
That's OK . The program is especially for the beginners like us .
Really ? When is it on ?
It begins at 6:40 every morning , and it goes for 20 minutes .
Thank you so much . I'll try and catch that .
The radio has brought us lots of convenience .
Yes , I can also learn about the traffic condition through it .
With the development of the society and technology , radio is nearly everywhere .
So we should take the advantage of it .
Mitsubishi , HP , IBM and many other famous corporations .
Does the 7th floor belong to our company too ?
Yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building .
It ' s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ?
Yes , at the end of the hall .
That's too bad . What's the earliest flight available ?
I can give you a reservation on flight No CZ 387 on July 22nd .
What about the fight schedule ?
It departs at 12:10 and arrives at 15:10 next day .
Is it a non-stop flight ?
Yes .
Sounds good . I'd like to take this flight .
Would you prefer first class or economy class ?
Economy class .
And your name , please ?
Edward Smith .
Mr . Smith , you can get things fixed through our agencies in Guangzhou . Do remember to bring your passport with you .
Yes , many thanks . Goodbye .
Bye .
These look wonderful . Do these come with a guarantee of quality ?
Of course . If there is anything wrong with them , you can come back and show me the guarantee of quality , and then you will surely get free service .
I ' ll take them .
Do you have a fever with that rash ?
No , it just itches a lot .
I have openings on Tuesday or Wednesday . Which would be best for you ?
I need an appointment on Tuesday .
Fine , I am putting you down for 9
I would like to see Dr . Jones .
I can schedule you with him with no problem . We look forward to seeing you .
Why do you want to go to the US ?
I'd like to have further education . Now I am studying for my doctorate .
Will you get any kind of scholarship ?
Yes . The school has provided me with full scholarship and that will be enough to support myself .
No , I didn't . Really !
Then , is the machine broken or ...
In that case , you should go to the baggage hall over there .
Oh yes , I see the sign , thank you .
Engaged . Oh , dear ! Could you tell her it's a long-distance call ?
I'm sorry , sir . I can't interrupt her . I'm sure she won't be very long .
How long do you think she'll be ?
I really can't say how long she'll be .
Can I leave a message , please ?
Yes , certainly .
Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ?
Yes , sir . I'll ring her on an inside line if you like .
Thank you very much .
My wife . She suffers from a bad cold .
What symptoms does she have ?
Fever and a bad cough .
I see . Don't worry , just a common cold .
What kind of medicine does she need ?
Patulin will be enough .
How many pills for each time ?
Nine pills per day , and three pills after each meal .
Thank you very much .
It's my pleasure .
I need five single rooms in October . How much of a discount can I get ?
Our summer season ended in September . So the discount will be 40 % . That ' s a good deal . Would you prefer rooms with a front view or rear view ?
Front view , please .
What date and time will you be checking in ?
October 25th around 2:00 in the afternoon .
We need you to send a deposit for 1/3 of the bill . You can send the check , or you can use the credit card .
Ok . I ' ll send a check .
Could you tell me your name , address and phone number , please ?
Sure . My name is Anderson . My address is 109 Ferguson East , Holton . And my phone number is 309 789 1267 .
Thanks .
I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars . Do you accept $ 100 bills ?
No problem , we can accept any denomination . How much would you like to exchange today ?
Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ?
It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7 . 45RMB . If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7 . 35 . Will that be all right ?
I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow !
Oh , what's wrong with you ?
I've got a fever and a very sore throat .
Well , you sound ill over the phone .
Yes . I have to stay in bed today , but I'll be able to come tomorrow .
That's all right . Have a good rest until you feel well enough .
Thank you , Mr . Smith . Goodbye .
Goodbye , Lucy .
Where do you think you have problems ?
There is no hot water , the bedroom has a broken window , and there are rats in the kitchen .
You know , no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before .
You are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment .
I will fix these problems when I get around to it .
I will be withholding my rent check this Friday unless these problems are addressed immediately .
You can ' t do that ! It ' s illegal !
We have tickets for the matinee . It starts at 3p . m .
Ok . I ' ll take it .
Where would you like to sit ?
Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes .
Certainly .
Just a moment , I'll look up the rate for air-mail letters to South America .
Can you tell me how much it will cost to send a package to Colombia ? Also , I what to know how long it will take .
Do you have the package with you ? I would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost .
Do you insure package ?
Yes . All you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for .
Is there a way that I can be sure that the people in South america receive my package ?
The post office rarely loses package . You can , however , request a rectum receipt .
One last question-what are your hours ?
We open at eight-thirty in the morning and close at five-thirty in the afternoon .
Thank you , you helped me a lot .
That ' s a pretty name . Give your wife my best !
I need to talk with Marry .
Certainly , hold on .
Thanks .
What's in the bag ? Would you mind opening the bag ?
Not at all . I don't know what's dutiable . Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use ?
NO . You don't have to pay duty on personal belongings .
Thank you .
How much does it cost ?
$ 600 .
Does that include the insurance ?
Of course .
Yes , this is also the competitive edge of our company .
I often eat fish and eggs .
Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
Oh yes , and fruits . I love fruits very much .
What do you like to drink ?
Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea .
Whatever would you like to drink ?
I drink a lot of milk . I drink milk almost every day .
How often do you exercise ?
Well , I walk every day .
It's a good diet and a regular exercise .
Yes , quite right .
It hurts smack in the middle of my gut !
Did this just come on suddenly ?
I felt OK until an hour or so ago , and then I just doubled over .
Have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently ?
No , and I don ' t usually get a lot of stomachaches .
We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is .
I think that that is the best way to figure out what is causing this . Thank you .
I didn't know . I'll go to get it . How late will you be open ?
Till 5:30 .
OK . I will send a maid to your room right now .
It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .
It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .
We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .
Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .
If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?
We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi .
I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .
Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .
It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .
Thanks , that was nice of you .
See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !
Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ' t need to be replaced .
How long did it take you to do the tiling .
As I hadn ' t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether .
I think you ' Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ?
You ' ll be lucky ! However , I ' ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself .
I don ' t have onions on my list . I ' ll add them . We should get some tea . Is green tea ok or should we get the same tea that we usually get ?
Let ' s get both . We need some coffee too . Is that on your list ?
Yes , it is . Here ' s my list . Is there anything that I ' Ve forgotten ?
I think you ' Ve got everything . I want to got some chocolate and some cheese .
What kind of cheese do you want .
I ' m not sure . I ' ll decide at the cheese counter , when I can see what they have . Have we got enough money ?
We don ' t have enough cash , so I ' ll take my credit card and we can pay with that . Where are the car keys ?
I ' Ve got them there . Shall I drive ?
Can you give us a rough idea of the quantity you require ? It is generally known that the price varies according to the quantity .
That is to say , 10000 sets for the one of white-collar and 5000 for men's jackets .
In that case , our offer for the white-collar series is US $ 200 , and the other is US $ 300 per set .
Do you quote CIF or FOB ?
We usually quote on a CIF basis and a commission of five percent for you . You will find our price is most competitive .
What are your terms of payment ?
Letter of credit at sight .
Another question . Could you tell me the earliest possible time of shipment ?
Within a month after your letter of credit reaches us .
Well , I got all the point . All the decision will be made since I get the approval from my supervisor .
OK ! I expect you to accept our general terms and conditions of trade . We believe that through our cooperation , large transactions will be brought to speedy conclusion .
That will make him so happy .
I'll get him one of those little dogs .
One that won't grow up too big .
And eat too much .
Do you know which one he would like ?
Oh , yes , I took him there yesterday . He showed me one that he really liked .
I bet you had to drag him away .
He wanted to take it home yesterday .
I wonder what he'll name it .
You're probably right . Oh , what the heck ! I'll take it all ... in maroon , like you said .
I have a little problem , I'm overweight for my height . I think I should go on a diet .
No , nothing in particular .
How soon can you begin working for us ?
I need about two to three weeks for necessary formalities . I will quit then transfer to your company .
No , I want the fish .
Our special tonight is lobster .
Thank you , but I prefer the fish .
Perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb .
No , I like the fish .
What ever you say ?
This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ' m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee !
That ' s great . Can you do it anywhere ?
No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
So , what programs do you have on your laptop ?
I ' Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs .
I know you are keen on photography . It ' s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at a
It ' s wonderful , isn ' t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I took recently ?
Make it French please .
I ' m a podiatrist . What about you ?
I ' m a nurse . What do you do in your free time ?
I like to play piano , go bowling and chat with my friends . And you ?
I like to hang out with my friends , play games and go swimming .
Would you like to go out some time ?
Sure , that ' d be great . Where would you like to go ?
Anywhere with you .
Aren ' t you sweet .
Yes , here you go . I don't need a visa to go to Spain , do I ?
Fortunately for you , you don't . Next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
That's good advice .
Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
Are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
Let me see here ... yes , there's one left .
Ok . I'll take that one then .
Alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
I like to travel light so I just have this one .
If that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?
Yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ?
You're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . Here's your boarding pass . Enjoy your flight !
Cheerfulness and friendliness .
How would your friends or colleagues describe you ?
They say Mr . Sun is a friendly , sensitive , caring and determined person .
What personality do you admire ?
I admire a person who is honest , flexible and easy-going .
How do you get along with others ?
I get on well with others .
That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options .
What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ?
Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into .
So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?
Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .
Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will .
After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ' m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice .
How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need ?
We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home .
Do you need to be located in a particular school district ?
It doesn ' t matter , as we do not have any children .
Is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ?
In a perfect world , we would like a home with a view of the lake .
Thank you for all of the information . I will help you find the perfect house for you .
Thank you . Where can I put my suitcase ?
Either in the overhead compartment or underneath the seat .
Everyone's attention , please . We are going to take off . Please fasten your belts .
This is the right bus .
Will you let me know where to get off ?
Certainly . Four more stop after this . I'll call out the stops .
Thank you .
Well . Go to the police station and see if it ' s there .
And please let white color dominate .
OK ! I've noted it down . And any others ?
Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city .
I'll tell them .
Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor .
Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery .
Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you .
I think so . Bye !
Bye !
What an excellent idea !
Shall we do some jogging ?
OK .
I feel well now .
Yes , some exercise is necessary for us .
Quite right .
A teriyaki bowl sounds nice .
I don't know how to make that .
All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef .
That sounds fairly simple , but how do I cook it ?
The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice .
What's next ?
Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it .
What's the next thing I need to do ?
Then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy .
How long does it take to reach Taiwan by sea ?
Usually about two month .
That's too long . How long does it take to reach Taiwan by airmail ?
About ten days .
Then how much is that by airmail ?
Let me see . It ' s 57 dollars , 20 cents , including tax .
That's a little bit expensive .
Although it's expensive to send it by airmail , it's quicker and safer than by sea .
I guess I have to send it by airmail .
Do you want to ensure the contents , Miss ?
Yes , please .
Please fill out this form , also please write the value of the items in this space .
OK .
Your clock never works . Perhaps you should buy a new one .
Well , if it breaks down again tomorrow , I'll definitely buy a new one .
Me , too .
Buy them now though , or they might not still be here tomorrow .
Good idea , especially at this price .
I don ' t know about that . with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ' t know if you ' re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ' s just too much instability . I wouldn ' t feel comfortable investing in this climate .
But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity . And anyway , I ' m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example . they have 1 . 4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .
Come on , son , you ' re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .
Fine , then ! If that ' s the way you feel , so be it . But you ' re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ' m going to go hit up Mum for the cash .
I'll buy an electric map of the city .
Time difference also makes me feel weak .
Oh , I forgot about it .
It's four o'clock in the morning in Chicago now , but it's time to go to bed in Shanghai .
Don't think so much . Take a good sleep and you'll feel better soon .
I ate pizza the other day .
So , what do you feel like eating then ?
How about some burgers ?
I already had a burger yesterday .
What are we going to do ?
We can just each get what we want to get .
That sounds like a plan .
Do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ?
I think they sell both at the cafeteria .
How much does a six-day tour by train cost ?
Five hundred yuan .
Does that include hotels and meals ?
Oh , yes , and admission tickets for places of interest as well .
That sounds reasonable . What about the five-day flying journey ? How much is that ?
Eight hundred and fifty yuan .
Covering all expenses ?
Yes . But there is no half fare for children . They must pay full fare .
Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ' s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime Finist
What ' s a cabinet ?
This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ' s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
Can any mp make a law ?
Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law .
I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ' s . most mp ' s vote the way their party wants them to .
How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Voters who often change the party they vote for are Calle
It's not so hot as it is here .
I see , sir . Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th , that's in a week's time ?
The 10th ? I'm sorry , but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th . Could you have the suit ready by the 8th , or at the latest , the 9th ?
Well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . But in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . How about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ?
That's fine , thank you .
Oh , this one ... Here .
May I try it ?
Sure .
It's very smooth . I'll take it .
Cash or charge ?
Charge , please .
I'm sure something is on sale . Please check with the produce person .
I ' m afraid I can ' t because I ' m a stranger here .
Oh , thanks all the same .
Not at all . You can ask the policeman over there .
No , that's OK . Do you have any whole wheat bread ?
We are out at the moment . May I suggest some rye bread ?
Sure that sounds good . Do you have any cakes ?
We have various birthday cakes and also ice cream cakes .
I'll just take a cheesecake .
Will that be all ?
Yes .
Your total is forty three dollars and twenty cents .
This is Li Ping of ABC computer company limited . I'm calling on our Mr Wilson the general manager of our company .
I'm sorry , Mrs Li , Mr Brown is now in a meeting . May I have your number , and ask him to call you back later ?
I'm afraid Mr Wilson would like to speak to Mr Brown right now . He ' s got an urgent matter to discuss with Mr Brown without delay .
Ok , then would you please hold the line ? Mr Li , the line is through , Mr Brown is ready answering the call , go ahead .
Thank you for your assistance , Mr Bush .
You are welcome .
Only as a clerk in a store .
I see . Well , consulting is a little different .
I'm a quick leamer , Mr . Jenkins .
Umm hmm . Do you have a diver's license ?
Yes , and I'm a very good driver .
Fine . We provide a company car for our consultants .
Do I have to travel a lot ?
Oh yes-five days a week . You have to visit customers all over the territory .
But how will I get to know the products ?
You'll have to attend a three-week course . If you do well , the job is yours .
How much is the salary ?
Starting salary is $ 150 a week-plus commissions , of course .
How much commission do your consultants get ?
Five percent .
Well , I'm very interested in the job .
Fine . The next course starts a week from tomorrow .
Thank you .
Good luck to you .
Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?
Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout .
This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ?
I am still waiting for their call .
Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward .
I'd like it medium-well .
OK , sir , wait a minute .
What ? What's wrong ?
I'm sorry but 5 of these notes seem to be counterfeit . Look at this watermark , do you see it ?
It does look a little strange , I didn't notice that before .
Oh ? That's a surprise . Let me see ... D 0411 Our dog's birthday . Yes , I'm sure this my parking space !
But I saw a red car always parking here before .
Oh , we've just repainted our car . It was red .
Maybe . But the car of this space has a broken rearview mirror on the left .
Yeah . It used to . We got that fixed yesterday too .
Could you wait for a minute , sir ? I'd like to have a check .
Sure , go ahead .
Sorry , sir , my mistake . This is your parking space .
That's all right . It's not your fault .
You mean the room thirteen-thirteen ?
I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhausted , but I can't sleep .
All right , ma'am . I'll check and tell them to be quiet .
If next room is still noisy , could you give me a different room , please ?
Fine , I'll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday .
I think the only reason is that I was too nervous during the interview and I couldn't express myself the way I wanted to .
What a shame ! You should have showed yourself to them !
It doesn't matter . I'll try other companies .
I suggest you hunt for a job on the Internet .
On the Internet ? I've never heard of it .
It's very convenient and it has become popular recently .
Is that safe ?
Of course , if you log on some standard websites .
Thank you for your advice . I'll have a try .
Okay , you take one end and I'll take the other .
Is that right ? We're very sorry .
I thought it was " the same day " service . Anyway , please do hurry .
I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock .
Well , then , would you send it to Japan , please ?
Yes , we'll do so .
OK , I ' ll be right back .
That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy . Will he be back soon ?
I'm afraid not . He's gone for the rest of the day .
Is there anywhere I can reach him ?
I don't believe so . He's going out of town on business . May I take a message ?
I have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , but I'm afraid I can't make it .
Would you care to make another appointment ?
Unfortunately , I'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and I may be gone for several days .
I see . I can tell Mr . Thomas that you phoned .
Thank you .
Bye-bye .
Tonight at seven .
I'm sorry sir , but we are fully booked tonight until eight .
In that case , eight o'clock is fine .
Very well , and how many people will attend tonight ?
Four people .
Lastly , may I please know what name I should make the reservation under ?
Mark .
How strange ! Our little emperor now asks to help out with shopping .
We learnt about vegetables and meat at school . But I never see the real thing .
Wow , that's something new . Let's go ! What's this , honey ?
Er , is it cabbage ?
Cabbage ? Is that what they teach at school now ? OK , honey , it's spinage .
Yeah , I know , this is Popeye's favorite food .
There we go .
Mom , come here . I know this , it is carrot , am I right ?
Bingo ! It's dark outside , Let's hurry up .
Actually , you might because there ' s a big convention in town this weekend .
I ' m not too worried about it . I always seem to find something .
But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate .
So you must be an extravert ?
Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them .
What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ?
A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment .
Don't you consider it a hard work ?
Hard but interesting , I think .
Have you any experience as a tourist guide ?
Yes , I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University .
Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English ?
Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well .
Look at this one . It's our biggest pan .
Yes , that is big enough , but it's too heavy for me .
Okay , we have the same thing in aluminum .
Oh , this is nice and light . But it has an aluminum handle .
Try this one . Same aluminum pan , but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle .
Oh , yes . This is very nice . I'll take this one .
That's a good choice . How do you want to pay for it ?
Cash . Oh , I almost forgot . I need a lid , too .
I'm so sorry . A lid comes with the pan . Here it is .
Okay .
Goodbye , Randy . Take care .
So , I can get my new card today ?
I'm sorry , Sir , the full procedure can take up to 7 days to process everything .
7 days ! What am I supposed to do for money until then ?
If you bring some ID with you , it's possible for you to make a withdrawal over the counter if you need to . But unfortunately , without your new card you cannot use the ATM , so all withdrawals must be made within working hours .
What's your flight number ?
Flight CA216 to Chengdu .
Yes , it's true . It has been delayed .
Could you please tell me why ?
Yes , of course . The delay is due to heavy rain .
How long will the delay be ? Do you have any further information about it ?
I am sorry , we don't know the extent of the delay at present . But according to the latest weather forecast , there will be a change in weather soon .
We have to wait . Well , is it possible for the rain to stop before noon ?
It's hard to say . Weather is so changeable in the summer . Please listen to the latest announcement about your flight .
Yes , I will . Thanks a lot . Bye !
Bye
Nice meeting you , too .
Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas .
I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails .
So you have to open all the envelopes .
Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly .
Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas .
I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night .
Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him . He loves " The King . "
I'll put the song at the front of the list .
So , do you think our corporation will be eligible for this ?
Yes , and it's extremely simple . All you need to do is make a Network Settlement Agreement with us .
it's hard to say . While dogs are more affectionate , cats are much easier to take care of .
have you ever had a dog ?
when I was little , we had a few domestic dogs at home .
they always say that dogs are a man's best friends . do you think that's true ?
definitely . rich or poor , dogs always love their masters .
how about cats ? Have you ever had one for a pet ?
i had one a few months ago , but she ended up running away .
how did that happen ?
she left through a window that was open one night and never returned .
you must have been devastated !
i was pretty sad . i still hope that she'll return some day !
I hope she does . Do you think you'll ever get another pet ?
I think I will . It's difficult to feel longly when you have a pet around .
i hope your cat finds its way back home .
i do , too .
What a shame that we can't take pictures .
We haven't made up our minds . Will you come with us ?
Of course , I will .
I see .
Do you have anything else I can have instead ?
Well sir , yes . How about this stew ? We can serve you at once .
I ' ll take this stew then .
How about sick days ?
You get five paid sick days .
Any other benefits ?
Yes , we have an excellent retirement plan and medical insurance as well .
Great . Thanks so much for your time .
We ' ll contact you soon , Ted . Thanks for coming in .
Don't be in such a hurry . I'm confident that you'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks .
Is there anything I should do ?
You'd better have a good rest for a week . Be sure to have regular meals . Stay away from alcohol . Give up smoking at least a little while .
Should I take some medicine ?
Yes . I'm going to give you some . Take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . For that one , two tablets . And remember to come to the out patient department for a consultation in two weeks , please .
It's very kind of you .
You're welcome . We wish you a speedy recovery . Goodbye .
Just joking . I would like to get a few bottles of beer though . We also need a liter of cooking oil .
we can buy a three-liter bottle . It works out cheaper per liter . We should buy a packet of butter and a few pints of milk too .
I ' d like to get a jar of strawberry jam and a bottle of tomato ketchup . Do we need any meat ?
I think we should get half a kilo of minced beef and a few pork chops .
Ok . Let ' s not forget fruit and vegetables . We need a bunch of bananas , a kilo of tomatoes and a bag of potatoes .
We should also get a tube of toothpaste and a bar of soap . Let ' s get a tub of ice cream too . We can treat ourselves .
Ok . We should get a few tins of tuna . Anything else ?
I ' d like a few cans of coke . We also need a dozen eggs and half a dozen sausages .
let ' s get a chunk of cheese too . Is that everything .
I think so . I ' Ve got the shopping list , so let ' s go .
Too long , and you do not have much time .
What a pity .
We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet .
You got lost . You're kidding !
No . We took a wrong turn somewhere . And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions . But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost .
You could have called .
I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were .
You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ?
Guess where we ended up .
I don't know . Where ?
When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield .
Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ?
I don't know . The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
I know it is . I don't know how it happened .
Hmm , maybe I do .
What ?
Maybe I have an idea how it happened .
How ?
You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road .
Oh , that's what you think , huh ?
I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable .
I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .
I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % .
I ' m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ?
We've already cut down our price to cost level .
Is that all ?
Yes , this is the best we can do .
I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered .
yes , please . Do you take credit cards ?
yes , we accept all major credit cards .
and how about Internet access ?
there's free Internet access in the lobby .
is it available in the rooms ?
Unfortunately not .
that's OK . Is breakfast included ?
yes , breakfast is included and parking is available .
fantastic . Thank you very much .
you're welcome . And we have 24 hour reception . Please don't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions .
My name is James .
What's your nationality ?
American .
What's your relationship with the victim ?
I don't know him .
Why did you attack the victim ?
Because he beat me first when I tried to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away .
How many times did you stab the victim ?
I stabbed his belly three times .
Did you know hat your actions might cause serous injuries or death ?
I knew , but I couldn't control myself .
Was it your intention to kill the victim ?
No . I didn't kill him on purpose , madam . It's him who caused the incident . I need to see my attorney .
OK . Give me his number and we'll contact him .
I never have seasonal allergies .
Consider yourself lucky .
What are all the symptoms ?
Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water .
That doesn't sound good .
No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ?
Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family .
Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol .
I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body .
That's pretty bad .
But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah .
Thanks for the warning .
Yes , I have a lot of previous experiences in sales . I worked in sales departments for two companies since I finished my university .
That sounds fine . Please give me your name and phone numbers . I ' ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . It will most likely be in a couple of days . Is it all right for you ?
Yes , my name is Brian and my phone number is 5294870 .
Thank you .
Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . .
I ' m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time !
I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ' t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures .
I ' m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP !
The Award Letter will tell you how much you will receive weekly .
Are there any other forms that I need to fill out ?
You will need to fill out a Continued Claim Form every two weeks .
What information will I need to provide on that form ?
They will need to know where you worked and how much money you made .
Are there any other questions on the form ?
Basically , they want to know that you were available for work and not sick .
Mom , I'll be finished soon .
Peter , if you don't turn off your computer , then I won't allow you to play it again starting next week .
Do you know what kind of vegetable you want to eat ?
Why don't you make some corn ?
How would you like the corn ?
I don't understand what you mean .
Do you want it boiled , grilled , or microwaved ?
Why don't you grill it ?
That's how you want it ?
Yeah , that sounds delicious .
Okay , I'll grill some corn then .
me , too . What did you have in mind ?
I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must .
I agree . They're very lovely , especially " Huan Huan " .
is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ?
the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive .
oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ?
I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now .
any other ideas ?
there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts .
it all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have .
May I ask , sir , if you enjoyed your stay ?
Well , except for one night , I enjoyed the hotel . And I loved New York , of course .
Thank you for your honesty . I assure you there will be no cockroaches next time .
Sure . Let me see ... at 6:15 a . m . local time .
I see .
And that'll be 10:15 p . m . Beijing time .
Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times .
Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ' s not really a shock for me .
Good , as long as you understand that .
And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ?
Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month .
That sounds ideal .
Sure . It's probably the skiing show . Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
See that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .
Hey , don't be so pathetic . It's a maximal sports show . What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ?
They are all very experienced and great skiers . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow in here ?
Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ?
Hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist .
Sorry . Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .
Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
It's possible . But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
It's a good thing . OK , let's go skiing .
Here we go .
Ok , where can I find their telephone number ?
They are all listed here on this sheet of paper .
Is it their home , office or cell phone numbers ?
Unless it ' s marked differently , it ' s their home numbers .
Alright . What if I can ' t get a hold of them by phone ?
Then , you should e-mail them with the information .
Where can I find their e-mail addresses ?
They should have then listed on their resumes .
And if there aren ' t any e-mail addresses ?
Then send them a SMS on their cell phone .
Ok . That sounds easy enough . Have you called any of them yet ?
Yes . I called the first three people on the list , but they didn ' t pick up .
Did you leave a voice message ?
I left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list .
I see . What did you tell her ?
I told her that she should call me back at my office number .
Ok , so , maybe I should call her again .
Yes , that sounds like a good idea . She might not get the other message in time .
One more question . It looks like some of these numbers are long-distance . Do you have a calling card that I can use to get through to them ?
Sure . You can use this one . The pin number is written on the back of the card .
Alright . Thanks a lot . Don ' t worry . I ' ll take care of it .
Great work . I ' m off for the weekend ! See you on Monday .
See you .
Orange juice , scrambled eggs , bacon , toast and coffee .
OK , and when shall I bring it here ?
About seven thirty . By the way , could you also bring me tomorrow's papers ?
Of course , sir .
No , I have some , but not enough for the long weekend .
Okay . I ' ll send someone to deliver it for you tomorrow .
Thank you .
No problem .
Let me see . I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday .
Great .
We will visit the Statue of Liberty as scheduled .
It's fish steamed and served with our special sauce .
Is it good ?
Sure . It's a most popular dish .
I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together .
We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ?
What kind do you have ?
We have French and Thousand Island .
Make it Thousand Island .
Sure sounds good to me .
I'm afraid so , yes .
Hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! Is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ?
Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake .
What do you recommend we do ?
I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible .
I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now .
I think I've got used to work under pressure . I will adjust myself to the step of your newspaper quickly .
I don ' t understand .
I ' Ve never used one before .
I can help you figure it out .
What do I have to do ?
Slide your card into the machine .
Then what ?
You need to type your PIN in .
What do I have to do next ?
Click on whichever option you want , and you ' re done .
Why are you switching jobs at this point in your career ?
Our Company is moving overseas and I wish to stay in the United States .
What are you best at ?
I am good at organizing systems that have been having problems .
What is your biggest challenge in terms of skills ?
I don ' t like to sit around and so like to always find things to do to keep myself busy .
That is good to hear !
Thank you very much .
Business .
Thank you . Have a pleasant stay .
Sorry sir , it is the only flight wa have right now .
Yes , of course .
Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ?
Well , uh ... I ' m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ?
Do you mind if I sit down ?
Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ?
I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ?
Yes . But why should you want to do that ?
Do you mind if I speak frankly ?
Not at all . Go ahead .
Well . You see , I don ' t like the office . I don ' t like the staff . And I ' m afraid of you . And I don ' t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ?
Yes . I ' d be delighted if you did .
Yes , that ' s the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ?
I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen ' s Boutique . I didn ' t know I could get it cheaper somewhere else .
Of course ! Everything at Helen ' s is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn ' t you shop around ?
I don ' t know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive .
What about cats ? They are more independent .
Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat .
How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ?
Yeah , are they easy to look after ?
Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything .
Could I see your driver's license ?
Sure here it is .
Good . Now just complete this form .
Of course not . We have cooperated for a long time .
Well ... there is a necklace in it .
Would you mind taking the necklace with you , or leaving it at the safe deposit box ?
Well , don't bother . I'll take it with me . Will that be all right ?
Thank you , sir . Here is your tag . This cloakroom is open till 11:00 p . m . , could you pick it up by then ?
Sure . thank you .
You are welcome . I am very impressed by your capability .
Is there anything I should do ?
No , nothing . It's thoughtful of you to call me again .
Thank you . Please call me at any time if you have any questions .
Ok , I will . Do you have any question ?
No , thank you . Goodbye .
Goodbye .
Really ! Oh , honey , you are so sweet . I'll chop up this carrot .
Mom , the water is boiling !
Honey , just turn down the stove .
yes , I'm going to take a holiday tomorrow .
How nice ! I can see you are busying packing . I'm sorry to interrupt you .
That's all right . I'm almost finished . Do you need my help ?
Yes , could you please go over this for me ? and see if there is any mistake in it ?
Oh . all right I'll read it soon .
Excuse me for taking your time .
It's nothing Navy .
Is that so ?
Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .
Have you decided ?
Yes . I want to get a better job .
Could you tell me why you want to quit ?
I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?
I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .
OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
Thank you so much for your advice .
And every best wish for your new job .
Thank you .
What ' s your name , please ?
Robert . Philips Robert .
Oh , really ?
Yes , I am a volunteer for the campaign .
I am very impressed .
I feel that history is about to be made , and I want to be a part of it .
That is very nice of you .
Will you be voting ?
Yes , I am going to vote .
Make sure you make it to your polling place early on Election Day .
Thank you and good luck .
Not too long . Cut a little off behind and on both sides , too .
OK . Now lean back a little and keep still . I'm going to shave your face .
What's the price difference ?
Regular is $ 1 . 15 , Super is $ 1 . 25 and Premium is $ 1 . 39 .
Just fill it up with Regular , Unleaded , please .
Do you want me to check the tires and the fluids ?
Yes , I would . Thanks a lot .
Would you be interested in seeing the apartment ?
I would love to see it .
Are you free today at around 6 p . m . ?
Yes , I will be able to make it then .
Well , I'll see you at 6 p . m . Do you know how to get there ?
I used to live in that area .
I'll give you an application form when I see you .
That sounds good . Do I need to bring anything ?
No . Just bring yourself .
I don't want to have a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing .
That sounds very reasonable .
It's the most important thing to me .
If you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ?
That obviously depends on how things go - - whether I'm suited to the firm and the firm to me .
Tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them .
I want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . In order to achieve this goal , I just want to work step by step .
What is your long-range objective ?
I haven't thought it over at all .
What do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ?
I think the most important thing is the interest in the job .
What happens now ?
Well , it's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . So , unfortunately you'll lose this 50 RIB . We'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
Then , you are to walk to work .
Walk ?
Thirty minutes in gym at lunch time .
Oh no .
Use the stairs , never the elevator .
Oh , dear .
And three times a week , you can either swim , play racketball , or hand ball .
Oh no .
OK , you can stop now . It ' s time for the dance class .
Dance class ! I don't know how .
You will .
Oh ...
No , it's the number fifty-eight .
So when's the next forty-four ? Will it be here soon ?
No , it won't .
So when will it be here then ?
Never .
Never ?
That's right . The number forty-four doesn't stop here any more . Its stop is round the corner .
You have made an excellent choice , it is our newcomer . The tapestry is on hot sell with the design and quality . The design on it is traditional Paris architecture .
How much is it ?
100 frances .
Mmm , it is reasonable . Look at this set of table wear , it is so beautiful !
We have a piece of table clothing to go with it . It is a brocade one with pretty stars .
This silver vase is a good ornament for the living room .
You are right .
I will take the tapestry , the set of table wear and the vase .
OK . Do you like these candles ? They are on sale now .
All right . I will take one .
I see ... calm down , don't worry . May I ask what were you doing when it took your card ?
Yes . I was only entering my PIN . I'm terrible at remembering it , I'm so forgetful , you see .
Mmmm ... and exactly how many times did you enter it , please ?
Maybe three times . As I said , I always forget it .
Ah ! Don't worry ; it's just a security measure . If someone uses a card and cannot get the right PIN after three attempts , the bank keeps the card in case it's stolen . Just contact the bank and we'll get it back to you .
Oh , I see . So if I call my branch they can sort everything out for me ?
Yes , they'll be happy to help . Believe me , it happens to many people .
I'd better try harder to memorise my PIN in future . Thanks .
You can bet on that .
Thank you , I will be doing my best .
It looks like you're very interested in the circus .
Yes , I love to see the animal show .
I have never seen those before , but since you're so excited it should be good .
I'm sure you'll love it .
Okay , I will go and get some popcorn first .
Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line .
What about the smaller components ?
They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory .
If you're in school , you can get a student pass .
Well , I am how much will that cost ?
The pass is free .
I don't have to pay for anything ?
You'll only have to pay for the monthly sticker .
How much is the monthly sticker ?
It's $ 24 for each month .
I'll take the student bus pass .
Okay , I'll get you one .
I have the same question . I can ' t send out mails . We ' d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately .
Ok .
Are you sure ? Do you have somebody in mind ?
Yeah . Let me see if he'll do it , and I'll get back to you .
OK . Just keep in mind it has to be somebody who can get along with Elvin .
Don't sweat it . I know just the guy .
I think so .
What ' s your polling place ?
My polling place is at the park up the street .
Oh , yeah ?
Yeah , where is yours ?
I don ' t know .
How is it you don ' t know ?
The location of my polling place never came in the mail .
You can always just check online .
Let me go do that .
Then how about this room , with just shower ?
May I see the room ? I ' ll take this room . Is the rate for the room only ?
No , sir . The tax is included .
That was smart .
Anyway , do you have any change I can use for the bus ?
I don't have any .
I don't know how I'm going to get home .
Get a transfer from the bus driver .
How much is a transfer ?
It doesn't cost anything .
That's great ! Thanks for your help .
You know what ? Don't mention it .
No , I'm not . I'm going to look for an apartment .
An apartment ? Why ?
I'm going to try to find a place near the office .
Where are you living now ?
Out in the suburbs . It's a long trip to work every day .
How are you going to find an apartment ?
I'm going to buy a newspaper and check the classified ads .
Apartments in the city are expensive .
I know , but I'm going to enroll in a night school to take a course in business management .
Yes , but the offer only lasts this week .
Well , ou can't hear music until takeoff .
I see . Thank you .
That was quick ! I wasn't expecting it until later this week .
Yes , our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast-track system .
Shall I come in and collect it ?
Or we can send it to you . But if you would like to use it at the ATM , you'll need to wait for your PIN number .
Mmmm ... if I come in and collect it this afternoon , is there any way I could use it today ? Petty cash is getting low , so I need to draw some money .
As long as you bring your ID , etc , we can serve you over the counter . But you won't be able to use the ATM until your new PIN number arrives .
I see . Yes , that's fine . I'll be there at around 2:30 pm . See you later , and thanks .
I ' m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere .
I ' m afraid I can ' t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ' Ve received from other sources .
But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ' s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries .
I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ' s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ' t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ' t changed much over the years .
There ' s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ' s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price .
Well , we ' ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ' ll have to try , I suppose .
Why ? I still wanted to talk to you .
I have things to do .
Like what ?
Don't be nosey .
I'm not . I just want to know .
Well , it's really none of your business .
That's harsh .
I'm sorry , but I have to go .
Fine .
What ' s the time ? My watch has stopped .
It ' s half past twelve .
When do you have lunch ?
From one to two .
What do you normally eat ?
We usually go to the cafeteria .
Oh , it ' s time to have lunch now .
let ' s go together .
I am glad to see everyone is here and on time . Let's get started ! Susan , toss out some of your ideas .
What doesn ' t feel right ?
I feel as if I am going to be sick to my stomach .
Perhaps you should get checked out at the Student Health Center before you go home .
I have some medicine at home that I could take .
Are you going to be OK to drive home , or would you like someone to go with you ?
Thank you , but my friend is in the library , and he can give me a ride home .
We hope that you are feeling better soon . E-mail me if you have any questions .
So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ?
It sounds like it will be .
I really hope it doesn't get cold .
That would ruin things , I want to go so badly .
The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know .
That is true . The weather is constantly changing .
It would be nice if the weather would never change .
That would be great , then we could plan things sooner .
True . Predictable weather would make life easier .
I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one .
I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ' t explained yet .
I ' m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong .
For example ?
Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics .
Yes . Such people don ' t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs .
I see . So , I need to stamp it . And sign it too ?
Yes , that's right . Down here , at the bottom right hand corner to show that you agree to pay the printed amount .
I'll go back to the office and get it sorted and pop back later . Thanks , bye for now .
Are you sure , sir ? Flies I could believe , but cockroaches ?
I've counted nine different cockroaches , and I accidentally stepped on another one .
Sir , we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel .
You dare to doubt me ?
I'm sorry , sir . Let me transfer you to my supervisor .
No .
Daddy , you always arrange your schedule so tight on weekdays . You should have a rest on weekends .
What park do you want to go to ?
Daniel wants to go to the aquarium . While Mom wants to visit the Summer Palace .
Haven't we been these places already ?
Yeah . I don't agree with them , but I don't have a better choice .
What about the Olympic park ?
Right , ah . It is so close to our home . How come we've never thought of that ?
The Olympic Park has a small forest . It is fit for picnic .
Very well , Go ahead .
OK . We offer a few different kinds of postal saving services . They have different interest rates .
I want the one with the highest interest rate .
That would be our Savers Plus account . You must pay 10 000 yuan into your deposit account . In this way you can get 5 % dividend at the end of the year .
All right . I'II open this one .
Just fill out these forms , and I ' ll be with you in one second .
Thanks .
This next one is from Betty .
A highchair and car seat ! Wow Betty , thank you so much ! I really appreciate it !
One more from Carla .
A playpen and crib ! Thanks Carla ! This is just what I needed !
OK , that ' s all of them . No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ?
Umm . I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital !
You mean at the mall ? Was there a sale ?
Yeah . For five minutes , everything was half off . It was total chaos ...
Cool !
Grabbing , pushing and shoving ...
Yes , it will print immediately .
Fine , we'll be expecting you then .
That would be our Saver's Plus account .
4 . 5 % , that's good . How much money do I have to keep in it to get that rate ?
You have to maintain a balance of $ 10,000 in the account or the rate drops to 3 % .
All right . I ' ll open one of those .
Just fill out these forms , and I ' ll be with you in one second .
Thanks .
Please do , the fitting-room is over there .
It feels a little tight around the waist . Do you have a bigger one ?
I'm sorry . We don't have this color in your size . We have some green ones in your size . Would you please have a look at this green one ?
OK . How much does it cost ?
It's 486 yuan .
I think he'll be back in about an hour at least .
Well , may I leave a message ?
Yes , of course .
Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ?
Ok . Does he know your number ?
I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 .
13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on .
No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk .
So , you're a serious coffee drinker .
Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted .
Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing . Everyone has to have something . For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ?
No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker .
Well , what would you like to talk to me about ?
I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .
I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it .
It is about the staff meetings . You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday .
Yes .
Well , I have been thinking about it . And I believe we could do things more efficiently here .
What do you suggest ?
The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week . We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation .
You mean because people have to go across town to get here .
Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road .
That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them .
I think they are important too . That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them .
I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that .
Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more .
Well .
I also think the meetings should be more focused . And I would be willing to take responsibility for that .
You mean you want to run the meetings ?
No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting . This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .
Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks .
I really think it would work . The meetings could be longer , and better organized .
I am not against the idea , Arnold . It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do . Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works .
Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it .
I will call the managers . Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this " new style . "
Would you show me some ?
Of course .
They really smell fragrant . How much is a real sandalwood fan ?
The small ones are one hundred yuan for each . And the big ones are two hundred and thirty yuan .
I'll take two small ones and a big one .
What else are you interested in ?
I'm afraid not .
OK . Here you are .
Is there anything else ?
There are a mouse and a camera .
Is that all ?
Yes . How much is it to send these things to Shanghai by regular delivery ?
It depends on the weight of these things . Generally speaking , we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram .
I see . Can you weigh them for me , please ?
Please go over there to weigh them .
OK . See you later .
I was pulled over for allegedly speeding .
Are you sure you weren't speeding ?
To be honest , I really wasn't .
What speed were you going ?
I was under the speed limit . I was going 35 , when the speed limit was 40 .
I'm just going to let you go , since the arresting officer isn't here .
What about my ticket ? Do I still need to pay ?
Don't worry about it .
I'm so glad for your help .
You bet . I wouldn ' t miss it !
Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out .
OK , it's not far from here .
I have something important to do , can you fast the speed ?
Sure , I'll try my best . Here we are .
How much should I pay you ?
The reading on the meter is 15 yuan .
Here's 20 yuan , keep the change .
Thank you very much .
the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing !
it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking .
I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children .
I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking .
all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty .
perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow .
I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them .
that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad .
you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking .
OK . It sounds fine .
I couldn't find the files you request , even though I checked all the cross-references . I don't think it's there .
I am sure that document was filed .
Well , let me check again under a different heading .
Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files .
Maybe that's why I couldn't find it . All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V ' .
It's about a ten-minute walk .
That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .
Not at all .
Furnished .
Very well . How long do you want the house ? All summer ?
No , not all summer . Just for six weeks .
I'm afraid I can only rent it for two months .
My holiday is only six weeks , but I think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks . Is the house in good condition ?
Yes , it is . It was just painted and it has all the modern conveniences .
About ten weeks in total if everything goes according to plan .
I'm sure it will . So , we should be able to start moving the machinery in during week 34 . I'll confirm that date with our suppliers .
I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way .
You seem to be a kind-hearted lady .
Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature .
Please tell me your weaknesses if you can .
I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection .
When should I take this medication ?
You need to take it at bedtime .
Should I take this medicine on an empty stomach ?
Don ' t mix alcohol with this medication , but you can take it with or without food .
What are the side effects of this medication ?
You might feel a little dizzy at first , but it should pass .
Could it be the battery ?
No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago . It must be other problems .
Well , I suppose it could be the gas .
No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday .
Perhaps it's the starter then ?
Yes , that's possible .
It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also .
Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch .
We ' ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it .
While you ' re cleaning the cooker , I ' ll wipe the worktop . That was a great meat , by the way .
Actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it .
My pleasure ! This tea towel ' s a little ragged . Do you have another one ?
Yes . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out .
Keep it and use it as rag . You can clean your bicycle with it .
Just a moment , please . I'll draw up your bill for you ... Thank you for waiting , sir . Your bill totals two thousand six hundred and fifty-eight yuan , including the phone and laundry .
That much ! Would you mind letting me have a look at it ?
Not at all , sir . Here you are .
Thanks . Well , It seems to be right . How much is that in dollars , please ?
Just a moment , sir . I'll calculate that for you . It comes to 305 dollars and 52 cents at today's exchange rate .
I see . OK .
How would you like to make the payment ?
In cash , please . Here you are .
Thank you , sir ... Here is your change . Could you check it , please ? Thank you for choosing our hotel . I hope you enjoyed your stay .
By the way , please forward my mail to this address .
Certainly , sir . We hope you have a good trip .
How long would you like to stay with this company ?
How long I will stay with the company depends on whether the company and I are satisfied with each other .
What do you think of this industry's outlook in five years ?
I do believe this industry will be developed rapidly in 5 years time .
Have you been feeling this way for awhile ?
I started feeling kind of sick last night after dinner , but this morning the pain got really bad !
Have you eaten anything unusual lately ?
No , not that I remember .
We are going to take you to an emergency room right now .
I will feel better when I know what the problem is . Thank you for the drugs .
No , you don ' t understand , I need this tomorrow morning ! I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ' s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! She ' s gonna kill me !
OK , I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon , but this suit is also very stained . I can ' t guarantee we can remove it completely .
Fine ! Can you also iron and starch this shirt ?
Certainly .
Great ! This is our secret ! If you see my wife , say nothing to her about this !
Besides the checking account , there's a monthly savings account and a daily interest account .
Oh , I think I'd like to take the monthly savings account then .
Would you fill out this form ?
OK . Here you are .
All right . And here's your deposit book .
Thank you . Goodbye .
Goodbye .
Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ?
No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them .
How do you spell your last name , Mr . Eakins .
It's E-A-K-I-N-S .
E-A-K-I-N-S . First name , Donald . And what's your present address , Mr . Eakins ?
It's 1446 Pine Street .
1446 Pine . That's in San Francisco , isn't it ?
Yes , it is .
I'll go into a practical training as soon as I receive my Master ' s degree from the University of Pennsylvania early next month .
We ' ll need a letter from your university and a financial statement from you .
Oh , I see .
Let's go to aisle 4 to pick up some pasta for tonight .
Great ! Pasta for dinner .
And let's get a loaf of bread at the bakery for breakfast .
Maybe we should get a shopping cart .
I'll put the shopping basket back .
Thanks , this will be a big help in putting together next quarter's marketing strategies . With competition this intense , we'll have to step up production even more . We need a price we can compete with .
We're in a very competitive environment . It's sink or saimin this market .
Better start swimming ! we've got to find a way to outsmart the other guys . I want a preliminarily strategic marketing plan on my desk by next Tuesday ... the competition never sleeps and neither should we .
Good , we'll take 500 suits .
OK , thanks for the order .
I think I lost my wallet here .
Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything .
Really ? You didn't find a wallet ?
No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ?
Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor . Has anyone sat at this table since we left ?
No . It's been empty the whole time .
Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened .
I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill . You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ?
No . My friend did .
Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ?
No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down . It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table .
Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home .
I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house . But what should I do ?
Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home . Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that .
Should I call the police ?
You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets .
Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home .
I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir .
Thanks for your help .
No problem .
Please handle the items carefully .
Certainly .
We will pay by collect on delivery .
I might . Vince knows he needs to keep me happy .
What about your accounts ?
Yes . I'm going to San Francisco .
Oh , it's a beautiful city . I think you'll like it .
Hey , I'm feeling much better already .
Sometimes if you don't think about it , that sick feeling will go away on its own .
Thanks . By the way , my name is Mary .
I'm Frank . Nice to meet you .
I ' m sure you can find your favorite there .
Thank you very much .
It ' s my honor .
Oh , we always go to the movies . Can't we do something different ?
Well , do you have any suggestions ?
Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ?
It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things .
Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
OK .
Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ?
Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance .
Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job .
I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work .
OK , let's go .
I see .
Do you have anything else I can have instead ?
Well , yes . How about beef stew ? We can serve you at once .
I'll take beef stew , then .
That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .
Not at all .
Where it is ?
It's a private garden .
RIB .
How much would you like to change ?
1000 Yuan . Here you are .
The pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic .
Great ! What floor is pharmacy on ?
The fourth . I'll send the prescription down there so you can just pick it up on your way out .
Thank you !
Any cigarettes or liquor ?
I have cigarettes for my own use .
I think you'll have to pay some duty on these cigarettes because they exceed the quota . And this article is liable for duty .
How much duty should I pay ?
One hundred dollars .
Here is the money .
Just a moment . I'll make out your duty memo . ( Writing and giving the memo to Mr . Green ) Take it and pay the girl over there .
Thank you .
During the peak season , a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night . But we ' Ve got a Single Super Saver Special going on right now -- only $ 30 a night . And we ' Ve also extended our checkout time 00 in
That ' s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients .
Yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . We can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . Of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking
That sounds great . Do you accept checks ?
I ' m sorry , sir , we don ' t . But we do accept all major credit cards .
Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity .
I see . What can I do now ?
You can send a compressed one .
Can I get you anything to drink ?
Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea .
Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
Thank you .
Oh , right . What time is it there ?
It's 10:00 P . M . And it's four o'clock in Los Angeles , right ?
Yes - four o'clock in the morning .
4:00 A . M . ? I'm really sorry .
That's OK . I'm awake now .
No , they just said it too many people were trying to get off at the Capitol exits .
Well , let ' s put on some music . We ' re going to be stuck in this for a while .
All right , what do you want to listen to ?
How about some Beatles ?
Yeah , all right .
The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ' t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do .
No , you needn ' t do that . You ' d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes .
But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ' m nearly 17 .
You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ' t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study .
What else I ' Ve got to do ? Join the army ?
Who knows ! That might come to later .
Would you like a window or an aisle seat , Mr . Smith ?
I want an aisle seat as close to the exit door as possible , please .
Very well . Do you have any bags to check ?
No , I just have this one small bag .
Here you are , seat 12c . Please go to gate 23 after passing through the security checkpoint .
Thank you .
Have a nice day .
You , too .
Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your left .
Oh , I see them . Some are doing Taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the Chinese Wushu .
A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China .
Let me check . Yes .
OK . I will take it .
When do you check in ? How long are you planning to stay ? Do you have any special requirements ?
I guess I am going to arrive at 9:00 in the morning and I would like to leave at 200 in the afternoon on Sunday . Please give me a room away from the elevator . I hate noises while I am sleeping .
OK . No problem .
Oh , these are the phone charges and these are for something from the bar .
Wait a minute . I made a phone call , but I never made a connection .
I know , sir . Those aren't telephone company charges . Those are hotel charges .
Isn't that a bit excessive ?
I'm sorry , sir . It's our policy .
OK . Here is the money .
Thank you . Welcome to our hotel again .
Well , honey , wake up , or you'll be late for school .
It sounds good . Could I go and see it myself ?
Certainly , you're welcome anytime .
See you later !
( after a while ) Good afternoon , Mrs . Smith . I called you just now .
Welcome ! Come in , please !
Yes .
This way please . Your room is upstairs ... Here it is .
Wonderful ! A modest , comfortable room . Ah , a beautiful window , through which I can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . How nice !
Yes , if you want to wash something , there is a separate lavatory room outside .
Excellent ! I like it ! When can I move in ?
Anytime you like .
OK .
OK . Here you are .
Let me check your parcel number . Song Ping's parcel number should be CP 06230221 5 CN . Here is your parcel .
Thank you .
Not at all .
About 3 minutes .
Does he have any other complaints ?
Three days ago , he began to cough , sneeze and have a running nose . Yesterday , he began to have a fever .
Have you taken his temperature ?
It was 38 ° C this morning and it was 39 ° C just now .
Let me examine him to see if there is any rash . No rash .
Is it serious ? Is it meningitis ?
No , it is not meningitis . Just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection .
Does he have to be admitted to hospital ?
No . No need for admission . I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . Then I will give you a prescription . The pink tablets are used for his fever . When his temperature is over 38 ° C , give him one tablet . The other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions . The white liquid is for the cold . Give the baby plenty of water to drink .
Thank you very much , doctor .
Is the sale going to include dresses ?
Everything you can see will be on sale .
I like the sound of that . I'll just come back next weekend .
The savings will be worth the short wait . See you next weekend .
We ' re going to the bookshop . Would you like to join us ?
Yes , I would . I need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , I love browsing through the latest paperbacks .
Me too . I need something to read on the flight to New York . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ' s books for her daughter .
I want to look at nelson Mandela ' s autobiography .
This is sure to be a worthwhile read .
I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices .
All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ?
How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan .
I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days .
It ' s rash . I ' d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ?
I bashed it against the chair in my room .
Does it hurt ?
A little , but not much .
Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ' ll take you to the doctor ' s after breakfast .
If I ' m better this afternoon , can I go to school ?
If you are better , but I doubt you will be .
How long will you be staying ?
Three or four days , perhaps longer .
Very good , sir . We will be expecting you next Monday , the 12th .
Well , this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up , half his face had been bitten off !
What ? How did that happen ?
They think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face .
Wow . What does his look like now ?
It looks pretty frightening . He doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . Most of his nose and chin are missing too .
What did he look like before his dog bit his face off ?
He was actually quite handsome . What a shame .
What's he going to do now ?
It said that he's hoping to get a face transplant , but until then , he's looking forward to Halloween so he isn't the only one wearing a mask .
Ms . Stevens will be with you momentarily . Can I offer you something to drink ?
Yes , a coffee would be nice , thank you .
Here you are . Ms . Stevens is ready for you now . I ' ll show you to her office , right this way .
Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ?
No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it !
You said you received your card this morning , am I right ?
Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ?
Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons .
Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me .
We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful .
I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country .
Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't ?
Yes . It is one of the Five Mountains .
I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ?
I'd love to .
Oh ... wait a minute ... here ' s my driver ' s license .
OK , just fill in this application . You can sit over there . This brochure explains our services . We have free checking , and you will be given a debit card and on ATM card . There is no service
OK , I ' ll fill out the form and come right back .
It ' s nearly half past seven .
My watch says ten past .
It ' s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight .
Are you sure half past seven ?
Positive . I ' ll put the radio on .
It ' s only seven o ' clock . Your watch is fast .
No , it isn ' t . It ' s stopped . I forgot to wind it up last night .
I could have stayed in bed for another half hour .
Holy cow ! I never heard of such a thing . How much do they cost ?
As a guest , sir , you pay nothing .
This sounds better every second . Now , when can I use the stations ?
If you want to swim , you can visit the gym any day between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m .
Oh , boy ! This is going to be great . I'm going to the gym right now !
I'm sure you'll enjoy your workout , sir . Everyone seems to like the swim stations .
No problem . I am used to it .
Actually it ' s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ' t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats ,
So who has to stay behind ?
Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone .
Ok . I ' ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket !
Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art .
Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ?
Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ?
I surely do . They must have had advanced machine in ancient China to do that .
No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .
Unbelievable ! I could never do that .
Thank you . Here is your tag .
Would you tell me the rate per day for depositing my bag ?
Sure , madam . Only one dollar .
When does the cloakroom close ?
This cloakroom is open until 10 p . m .
Oh , dear ! I won't be back until about 11:30 tonight . Where can I pick up my bag ?
We will transfer your bag to the Lobby Floor Cloakroom . You may collect it there , madam .
I see . Thanks a lot .
You're welcome .
What is the difference between them ?
The cable will take less time for your account , in the meantime , the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one .
Well , I think the cable is better .
OK , please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary , your name and telephone .
All right . Here you are .
Everything is OK . The commission is 50 yuan .
Here you are . Thanks a lot .
When will it be available ?
Next Wednesday .
Thank you . Can I offer you some refreshment ?
Why not , thank you . A little tea would be nice .
The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear .
I see , and what about the keyboard ?
I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work .
I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages .
Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways .
You are very modest . Best luck in your new position .
Thank you . I won ' t let this promotion change me .
We have a flight that we'll put you there at ten AM . Is that ok ?
Nothing earlier ? I prefer flight at nine thirty .
I'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight .
No , exactly not
How about afternoon ?
Sounds not good . I won't take it .
What's the secret then ?
It lies in perseverance .
Well . It's hard for me . I can't keep doing exercise .
You should have a try .
So there isn't air in the glass boxes ?
No , there isn't . They are all vacuumed .
I wonder how old these things are , thousands of years ?
Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time .
Hey , look at the three-leg cup . I've seen it on TV .
The bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless !
Yeah , it has no value at all . Who will use this cup today ?
Danny , priceless means so valuable that you can't put a price on it .
Oh , it does ?
Were you involved in any club activities at your university ?
Yes . I was a member of the basketball Society . I like playing basketball .
What extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ?
I sometimes played basketball and sometimes played football .
That seems very impressive . Good work !
Thank you , but I cannot take all the credit . Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level .
Yes , my friend and I just had breakfast at the dining room , but we didn't use any services .
How about the charge for the days you shared the room with your friend ?
Please add to my account .
The total for the eight days is five hundred sixty yuan .
OK . Here you are .
Oh , that ' s right . Go ahead anyways . I ' ll fill him in . We can ' t lose this order under any circumstances !
I know , it ' s a big one .
Yes . It ' s quite troublesome .
Why not go and find a porter ?
I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it .
Good luck to us .
Oh , this is fine .
Thank you very much .
That's all right . Have a good day .
I am a volunteer for this year ' s campaign .
That ' s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand .
I know history is about to be made , and I would like to be a part of it .
That ' s fantastic .
Are you planning on voting ?
I ' m going to vote .
Go to your polling place early on Election Day .
I will . Good luck with your volunteering .
A dressy party would be fun !
That will work out fine . Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best ?
We should probably have both .
Yes , that will work out fine . Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ ?
Maybe we could do both !
Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details .
Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?
Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
Looks good ! I ' ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ' t forget the syrup !
Miss Lu , have you got any experience in restaurant service ?
Yes . Since I entered college , I have been working at a fast food restaurant as a part-time waitress .
For how long ?
3 years .
Our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . Can you serve them in English ?
That's why I applied for this job . Now I am studying Hotel English in my college , and I am quite familiar with the western courtesy and restaurant etiquette . I am sure my public relation skills will leave a strong impression on your customers .
You must know our working hours are very long and overtime work is frequent .
I don't mind that .
I think I will give you a 3 months ' trial . The salary for this period is 800 yuan a month with no bonus . After that period if we both feel satisfied , a formal contract would be signed .
When am I supposed to start working ?
Next monday . Bring your resume and diploma with you .
Yes , I will . Thank you , Mr . White . Goodbye !
Goodbye !
How do you think if I volunteer for some work ?
I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives .
Can it keep going ?
Sorry . You'd better get off for taking another taxi .
Those are the ones that are pre-dipped in sweet coating !
Yep . And there's real strawberry chunks in the coating .
Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?
Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either !
That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ?
Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner !
OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here .
How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ?
Barbie ? You know , I might be seven , but I'm not a girl .
Do you have a better plan ?
All right , all right .
Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
ok ... sure .
Let me see . I quoted your delivery in three months , didn't I ?
Yes , but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible .
I thought you would be worried about it . So I rang Auckland last night . As you are our biggest customer , they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave Auckland next month .
Good , if you agree we'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then .
By all means .
Please tell Tim to close the door to the basement . I don't want the dog down there tonight .
Okay . Good night . See you at breakfast .
Try listening to some soft music .
It won't work . I'm nowhere close to being tired .
I really don't care , just go to sleep .
What if I stay up and do something , until I get tired ?
You'll be up all night if I let you do that .
I'm going to get to sleep eventually .
You need to go to sleep now , so go to sleep .
Good night .
Do you mind if I go with you ?
Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
I learned to negotiate from my mother . I thought I was pretty good at bargaining , but I had a problem the other day at Kimble's Department Store .
What happened ?
I wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . It was priced at forty dollars , so I started by offering the salesclerk thirty .
What about a green tea or perhaps a jasmine tea ?
What ' s this one ?
That ' s Oolong tea -- it ' s a Cantonese tea .
Ok , I ' ll try that .
Oh , no ! I've got all I need for my stay here .
So , what's the problem ?
I need souvenirs !
You want some souvenirs !
Yes , yes . Souvenirs .
But , sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items .
That's not the same thing . If you buy hotel souvenirs , they have no sentimental value .
I understand , sir . I'll call housekeeping . You'll have your souvenirs shortly .
How about this one ?
It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I'd like it better . This seems too light for winter . Do you think you could get me one ?
All right . I'll show you something darker . Do you like this one ?
It looks good . But can I try it on ?
Of course . Let me help you .
Thanks . It's comfortable . Well , how much is it , please ?
$ 280 .

You're welcome . Bye .
Here it is .
Thank you .
I'm always at your service .
Peter , if you don't do it soon , I will throw your toys in the trash can .
I can see that from your resume . Your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company , is that right ? Later , why did you decide to leave your former post ?
I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new .
I see . Do you want to work full-time or part-time ?
I would rather work full-time .
I'll make note of that . Now , what are your salary expectations ?
I am willing to negotiate , but I expect at least $ 40,000 a year .
Is this to go or to eat here ?
To go , please .
That comes to four dollars and ten cents .
And can I have some ketchup , please ?
It's on the service counter over there . Please go to help yourself .
Do you have another account with us ?
I sure do .
Would you like to transfer money from that account into your new one ?
That ' s fine .
How much would you like to transfer ?
Transfer $ 100 .
Give me a moment while I complete your transaction .
That ' s fine . Thank you .
What's your case ?
I was pulled over for running a red light , but I never did .
Do you believe that the officer lied ?
There was a camera on the signal . So , he was obviously lying .
Your license plate was caught on camera ?
A picture of my license plate was never taken .
Since there is no picture of your license plate on record , I'm going to let you go .
Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me .
Yes . This is what is called road rage .
I love your outfit right now .
Well , I think you look nice today too .
Thanks . I found these new shoes earlier at the store .
I think that those are some really nice shoes . What kind are they ?
These are Chucks .
Your shoes look really nice . How much did you get them for ?
They only cost me about forty dollars .
I'm going to go get a pair for myself .
The next one to my destination . I have to be there as soon as possible .
1808 . The toilet doesn ' t work properly ; the water doesn ' t run in the shower .
I ' m awfully sorry to hear that . I ' ll turn to it right away .
thanks for flattering me .  i think you dance much right ?
no , just occasionally
oh , i like this music very much , let's tango .
i'm afraid i can't dance well .
I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course .
No , I don't risk it .
How about a delicious dessert then , with our compliment ?
I'm not keen on dessert as a habit . They are fattening .
I see , sir . I'm sure everything will be right next time you come .
You shan't drink more wine in the evening .
Yes , you are right .
And you'd take some exercise every day .
Many thanks for your advice .
Yeah . For five minutes , everything was half off . It was total chaos ...
Cool !
Grabbing , pushing and shoving ...
Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate .
I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ?
Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu .
Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today .
Are there many employers ?
Yes . The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers .
So there will be many large companies in the personnel market , right ?
Yes , there are many famous corporations .
When will there be a job fair ?
Every Saturday and Sunday
Do I need to pay to go into the personnel market ?
No , it's free .
How about going there to have a look now ?
OK , let's go .
What challenges is your country's economy facing at the moment ?
We do face a lot of challenges because there is still much uncertainty about the world economy . It's very important for us to strike a proper balance between investment in fixed assets and household consumption .
I've been reviewing your work over the past few months . Thanks to your excellent work , we benefit much from your project . And you should get the perfect attendance award too .
Thanks for your trust . Owing to my colleagues ' help , I've successfully completed my task .
You are very modest and diligent . The distribution of bonus derived from the performance evaluation . You deserve it .
Thank you very much . I will redouble my efforts in the future .
My mother can make some Chinese food .
Really ? That's wonderful !
Well , probably . Probably you will have to wait in line if you don't have tickets .
Outside or inside ?
Outside , on the sidewalk .
Hmm . It's very cold today . But I brought my jacket . Maybe it will be alright to wait .
The MYOMA is very popular . There will be a lot of people .
MYOMA ? What's that ?
Oh , sorry . It stands for the Museum of Modern Art . It's an acronym . M O M A MYOMA .
I see . Do you have any suggestions for other things we should do ?
I suggest you go to the Jewish Museum . It ' s not far from the Guggenheim , near Central Park . It is really very interesting . Also , there is a great museum of medieval European art further up north . It ' s called the Cloisters .
How can we get up there ?
You can take a bus .
But Larry says the neighborhoods in the north are dangerous .
I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
How much do you think the rent will be ?
I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
That's OK . If you want the photo I will mail it to you .
No need , sir .
The last one is black and white , all the rest should need color .
OK .
I hope they will come out well . When should I pick them up ?
They will be ready at noon tomorrow . Each negative develops one print , right ?
Yes , it is . And develop them as glossy as possible .
No problem . Do you need another film ?
Yes , a roll of Kodak film please .
It is totally $ 20 including the deposit for films .
I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse
what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?
it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .
I see , so it's similar to global warming ?
they're related to one another , yes .
I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .
people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .
people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .
I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place .
Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .
What do you mean ?
Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .
But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .
Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .
I still think we should have a realtor . We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has
Of course we need a home inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .
So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?
It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .
And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?
Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .
Why ?
Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .
Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .
It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .
I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .
Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store .
What kinds of channels can you use in e-commerce ?
We can complete a trade by email , electronic data interchange and smart cards , and so on .
What are the benefits of e-commerce ?
Firstly , it can overcome the geographic limitation . And secondly , e-commerce can lower the internal costs . And thirdly , people like us , can also open stores on Internet .
How things have changed now !
I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .
Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?
I don't know .
I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .
What do you mean ?
We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time . We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .
I have plenty of gas .
Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working . We can't just let the car run and run . If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .
So what can we do ?
Turn the lights off . Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . That will conserve the heat as long as possible .
Alright . That's a good idea .
I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .
Days ?
Yes , it happens . That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .
Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .
Probably we'll survive . But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .
I promise if you lend me five dollars today , I will repay you in full next week .
Ok , but I'm taking your skateboard as collateral .
Fine ! I can't believe you don't trust me .
It's nothing personal , just business .
Not at all . That's what I should do .
This particular refrigerator is a very good choice .
Tell me about it .
Not only is it affordable , but it comes with all the appliances .
What are the appliances .
It has an ice maker , water dispenser , and plenty of room on the inside .
I'd like to see it for myself .
Go right ahead .
I like what I see .
It has been seasonal during these past three years .
Are you sensitive to other things ?
Yes , things like seafood and penicillin-type drugs .
OK . Let me examine your nose . According to your case history and the examination , I believe that it's allergic rhinitis .
What useful treatment can you offer ?
I'll give you a series of specific skin tests . Then we'll know exactly what substances you're allergic to . Then I'll give you some causes of desensitization therapy .
But you bought it only last month .
Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired .
How long will it take us to get there ?
I think about ten minutes by bus .
It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain .
Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus .
Well , may I leave a message ?
Yes , of course .
Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ?
Ok . Does he know your number ?
I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 .
13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on .
He must have been in bad company , or he wouldn ' t be off the beans .
My old card is perfect , so all I want you to do is copy it exactly .
I think you'll be very pleased with how well we duplicate your old card .
... Here you go
Thanks . Come back here next Wednesday to pick up your order , please .
I'm sorry , but can you give me a three-day turnaround ?
If you don't mind paying a little extra , it's absolutely no problem .
Did he want to know the reasons ?
Yes . I told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession . But I thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only .
That ' s sex discrimination . When will you get the reply ?
In a couple of days , I was told .
Wish you good luck !
Thank you .
It is 45 yuan on the meter .
Is there something wrong with your meter ?
No . I am sure about that .
OK . Could you give me a receipt ?
Yes . This is your receipt .
Yes . Just look at her colorful feathers . What else can it be ?
I see . It's interesting that there is also a parrot in my English book . His mane is Polly .
Really ? A foreign parrot !
He can speak English , too .
Maybe you can teach Lulu some English words .
Lulu . Lulu . Say hello . hello . Oh , she is so smart . Good bird .
Don't mention it . It is my duty .
Thanks again .
As we are a well-established company , we are very familiar with the customers ' needs . Besides , we can make full use of our good connections with the wholesalers and retailers here and develop a good market for your products if appointed as your agent .
Sounds reasonable . I will tell my boss about you agent application . Another question , what do you think is the minimum annual sales you can guarantee ?
To be on the safe side , and for garment of all materials , sizes , and styles , I think the amount will be 50,000 pieces a year .
Well . As our sole agency , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own .
No , certainly not .
Everything for summer is 20 % off .
I like this T-shirt . Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with it ?
Sure . We have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the T-shirt . Look at this section .
This one is good .
You have good taste . It is very much in style this year .
I'll take this one . How much are they ?
160 yuan .
Here you are .
Well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . Besides , you should let old people on first .
Sorry .
It ' s all right . Where are you going ?
I wanted to see the White House .
Oh , well you don ' t want this bus , anyway . It goes to Georgetown .
Oh , no .
It ' s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A .
Oh , well thank you very much .
You ' re welcome .
There is no need . I will come back tomorrow .
You are an expert on it . That wood carving is very rare . But I'm so sorry . that is not for sell .
That's OK . Is anything else recommended ?
Do you have any special request ?
I'd like to see some traditional arts .
So that means you are shopping for presents ?
Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends .
Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle .
Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut .
I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best .
You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale .
As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country .
Wow , you are the expert on it .
I have a TEFL certificate .
How many years of experience do you have ?
I have three years of teaching ESL and four years of teaching per-school children .
When did you get your TEFL certificate ?
I got my TEFL certificate three years ago .
Why do you want to teach at our school ?
Well , I ' Ve heard many good things about it . I also like teaching young children .
That ' s great . Can you speak Chinese ?
Yes , just a little .
Can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10:00 ?
I sure can .
Great . See you then .
Well , if you're not seeing anyone , maybe we could ...
... I am seeing someone . This is Yi-jun , my ...
This is really wonderful party .
Yes , you are always popular with everyone . and you look very pretty today .
Thanks , that's very kind of you to say . I hope my necklace goes with my dress , and they both make me look good I feel .
You look great , you are absolutely glowing .
Thanks , this is a fine party . We should have a drink together to celebrate your birthday
No , we can't . It's thundering .
Then let's go to that store .
Thank you for your help .
Not at all .
It ' s as easy as pie . I always follow recipes .
Don't you think you would miss having other people around ?
No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy
If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ?
That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like
Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?
I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children !
In the hotel .
Have you made a reservation ?
Yes , we have .
That's OK .
Have you got a temperature ?
I think so . I feel very hot .
Let's see . Yes . You ' Ve got quite a high temperature .
I've got an awful headache , too , and my throat hurts .
Hm ... I think you ' Ve got the flu .
Is it serious ?
No , not at all , but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine .
How often must I take it ?
Three times a day after meals .
Thank you , Doctor . Goodbye .
Probably another week .
Oh , I see . Well , I ' ll give you my phone number and if you need a guide , please call me .
Thank you very much . That ' s very kind .
Do you often suffer from backache ?
No , I don't . I've never had a bad one before .
When did it start ?
About four days ago .
Well , go home and rest in bed for two days , then you'll feel better .
Can you give me some medicine ? It's very painful .
Yes , I'll give you some pills . Take one a time and three times a day , and come back in three days . If you don't feel ...
I ' d like to know more about it .
Can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o ' clock ?
OK . I will be there .
Thank you for calling . Goodbye .
Bye .
Really ? What time and where ?
7:30 PM at London-Chinese restaurant . I \ ' ll be at your place at seven to pick you up if you need a ride .
Yes , please , I'll need a ride . I'll be waiting for you then .
See you tomorrow at seven . Make sure your dress a little formally . I heard the restaurant is kind of upscale .
Thank you , see you then .
See you .
No , you can take it away now . I just need you to sign here .
Here you are .
Just one thing before you go , could you please prepare your documents in accordance with the L / C within the validity period ?
No problem , I'll get on that right away . Thanks , bye .
I know what you mean . I'm like a yo-yo .
Last week I was down to 60 kilos . This week I had one donut more . Now I'm up to 62 kilos .
Yes , of course . May I have your name , sir ?
Bruce By the way , can we have a table by the window ?
we ' ll try to arrange it , but I can ' t guarantee sir .
That ' s fine .
your table's ready , sir ? Please step this way .
Do they charge for that ?
Of course . In Europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service .
Is it the same in America ?
They do the work without charge to the importer .
It's part of their service , isn't it ?
Exactly .
Is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ?
No , you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment .
I see . By the way , how do we prove the ownership of our goods ?
You must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice .
I see . Thank you .
You are welcome .
I would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik . They are very easy to carry .
So , we'd like to see some embroidery .
Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time !
Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers .
Great ! I ' ll take it .
Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train !
I understand . Thank you very much !
Have a great trip .
Thank you , the service was good
Please come again .
Really ? What's the series about ?
Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it .
It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth .
I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results .
Really ? that's interesting !
Yeah . Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good .
OK , I'll give it a go .
I ' m sorry . Dr . Galas is fully engaged tomorrow morning . How about the day after tomorrow at 9:30 in the morning ?
That ' s fine . Thanks .
You ' re welcome . Could I have your name and phone number , please ?
Certainly . My name is Janet Smith , and my phone number is 610-555-1234 .
Very good , Ms . Smith . I have scheduled an appointment for you on Wednesday at 9:30 am .
Thank you very much .
You ' re welcome .
This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords .
Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ' ll deposit one month ' s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ' s rent in advance . I understand that I ' ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs .
Yes . If you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out .
Can I pay you by check ?
Sure . A check will be fine .
Is there a laundry room in the basement ?
Yes .
Can I sign the lease right now ?
Thank you .
I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not .
Well , it looks like you have . You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out . Can you just refill it once more ?
I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription . And this prescription has run out .
But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription .
Miss , I understand your problem . But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it . We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never .
But I have a prescription . I just need more of it .
A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law . You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor . It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens . But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry .
This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it .
Maybe that's true . I don't know . But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too .
Where do you see yourself five years from now ?
I see myself in a management position .
Yes , it did . It went off thirty minutes ago . You slept right through it . You're like a dead person while you sleep .
I must have slept right through it .
Rise and shine ! Sleepyhead !
Just let me sleep five more minutes .
The early bird gets the worm .
I know , I know . But I don't want any worms .
Ha ! Ha ! If you don't make an effort now , later on it'll be a lot tougher for you .
I always have the temptation to eat something there .
Then , why didn't you do that ?
I don't know how much we can trust them . Do you have any ideas ?
Some of them , I think , are not good .
It doesn't taste good ?
No , I mean some of them are not clean enough .
That's my greatest concern . But how can you tell which one is clean ?
I judge by appearances .
I got it . I think it's worth trying .
It certainly is .
I'd like to try some kebab , roasted squid , and many different appealing things .
Don't try everything at one time , please .
I see . Thank you .
Alright . Maybe it's the only way to do it .
It ' s ok , I know how it is . This machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ?
Well , I don ' t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio .
In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ' s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ' s a lot of weight !
It ' s not that much . Just watch ... I ' m ok ...
I see , please wrap it .
What's the weather like in spring ?
It's often windy in March . It's always warm in April and May , but it rains sometimes .
What's it like in summer ?
It's always hot in June , July and August . The sun shines every day .
Is it cold or warm in autumn ?
It's always warm in September and October . It's often cold in November and it rains sometimes .
Is it very cold in winter ?
It's often cold in December , January and February . It snows sometimes .
Unfortunately , not .
OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan .
Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away .
You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
But I don ' t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .
I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
Yes , I have to be there to meet a friend at 5 thirty pm . So we're sure we can get there on time ?
I'm afraid not , sir . Generally we can , but you know how it is in the rush hour now .
I see . Here's the extra 5 $ for you if you can get me there on time .
All right . I'll do my best .
Oh . we made it . Thank you . How much do I own you ?
The reading on the kilometer is 12 $ .
Here's the money , keep the changes , please .
Do you need a receipt ?
No , thank you .
That's a little more than we had planned .
I think you'll find I'm worth that .
I can only offer you 110,000 Yuan a year . Raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance . Is that satisfactory ?
Yes , it is quite reasonable .
Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
What do you drink ?
Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
What do you drink ?
This will be my first time using an ATM .
I can help you with that .
Explain to me how to use it .
Just put your card into the machine .
Now what do I do ?
Then you need to type in your PIN .
Now what ?
Just click on one of the choices they give you , and that ' s it .
I'd like a bottle please .
I'll need to see your ID please .
Here you go .
Sorry about the inconvenience , you look so young . I had make sure you are over 21 years old .
And what date will you be returning ?
Hmm , I guess on the 28th .
Okay , you ' re booked on American Airlines flight 710 , departing JFK at 6:40 p . m . on September 17th . Your return flight is flight 711 , departing London ' s Heathrow Airport at 11:15 a . m . on September 28th .
Sounds good . Thanks a lot .
Thank you very much .
It's our pleasure .
I doubt that .
Nothing like that . My cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him , so he's going to sell it - cheap . It's practically new .
well I have been thinking about getting a newer car . I can't afford a brand new one .
Would you like to look at my cousin's car ?
Is it a four-door or a two-door ?
It's a coupe with a vinyl roof .
Does it have automatic transmission ? .
Yes , and it also has power steering , power brakes , and air conditioning .
I guess I might take a look at it .
Your name and examination number , please .
My name is Du Tao , number 3 .
Pardon ?
Du Tao . D-U for Du and T-A - 0 for Tao .
Yes , Mr . Du , when were you born ?
I was born on January 1st , 1988 . I ' m 20 years old now .
Where do you live ?
I ' m living at Room 222 , Building 18 , N . P . U .
Can you leave me your phone number ?
Gladly , 8962105 2 .
It always hurts . I hate going .
Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
O . K . , O . K . , I ' ll go .
Good . You feel better after you do .
I see . You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ?
That's right . You should give it up , too . It ' s bad for your health .
Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying .
But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started . Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip !
What do you mean ? What are you talking about ?
I mean you couldn't give it up !
Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce .
That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ?
Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out .
That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ?
Early in the New Year I guess .
That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for .
I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent .
The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on .
Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave .
Thank you , Mr . Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr . Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients .
Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed .
I will . Many thanks , Mr . Black .
Sounds good . May I have a look ?
Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on .
They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs .
All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality .
Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ?
This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac .
Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones .
OK , I will wrap them for you .
What should I do ?
Take a few days off from work and don't wear yourself out .
Well , can you help me look for it ? That's my first time here .
Sure . It's my pleasure . I'd like to help you look for the missing keys .
It's very kind of you .
It's not a big deal . Hey , I found them .
Oh , thank God ! I don't know how to thank you , guys .
You're welcome .
No , only the articles listed on the Declaration .
That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony .
Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration .
Well , thank you for coming . We ' ll let you know as soon as possible .
Sure . It's a popular dish among young ladies .
I think I'll try it .
We have three kinds of dressings for salad . Italian , French and Thousand Island . Which one would you like ?
French , please .
OK . Do you want to order something else ?
Milan Style Macaroni . Don't put sugar or salt on it , please .
Okay , I'll take these two magazines and a copy of Today's Post .
OK . I will .
I'll have our housekeeper come right away .
I'm sorry I was too tired to fall asleep .
When you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub .
Right . Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ?
Hello , George . What ' s up ?
It gives your skin a very natural healthy look .
I like the cool smell , too .
We'll make it except a jam . You know it's rush hour .
There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
I'll do my best .
Here's twenty dollars .
Do you have small bills ?
No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ?
Here is your receipt . Thank you .
Along Queen's Road ...
Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel .
Right at the Hilton .
Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral .
The Cathedral ?
Yes . Then cross the road at the next traffic lights . The Peak Tram is straight ahead . You can't miss it .
That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ?
Yes . Why ?
Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down .
When do you want it delivered ?
I need it delivered tomorrow . Will that be possible ?
What time exactly ?
I need it delivered at 12 o'clock .
We can have it to you at that time .
That's not a problem ?
We will deliver your mattress tomorrow at 12 o'clock .
That's great ! Thank you very much .
All right .
Good . Now the other eye .
Well , this one is worse .
Never mind , just read as far as you can .
I can only read the first three lines .
Oh . You're right . I misread the ad .
Yes , many people make that mistake .
Well , you can't blame them . It's a confusing ad .
You're right . Many ads are like that .
Well , as long as I'm here .
Just one second , and I'll give you the batteries that are on sale .
Six months .
Oh , well , that might be a problem . I usually only sign one year leases .
Well , one year would be fine , too . I ' m not planning on leaving the area anytime soon .
Well , if it ' s not a problem . Then here you go .
Just let me look at it quickly .
Of course .
Looks like a standard lease .
Yeah , and don ' t worry about the security deposit . If everything ' s all right when you move out , you ' ll get it back .
O . K . Great . Just sign and date it here ?
Yes . Thanks . You can move your stuff in tomorrow .
Wonderful .
That's fine . Let's get on the bus .
It looks too big for you , but I like the color and the material is good quality . Is it on sale ?
Yes , it ' s half price . It ' s supposed to be too large--that ' s the fashion .
I might get one too , but in a different color . I prefer light blue to white .
There . It looks great , don ' t you think ? I ' m going to get these jeans as well . I need a new pair . I ' m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter .
I ' m getting this beret ? Doesn ' t it look cool ? I ' d like to get some jeans too , but I don ' t have enough cash on me .
Don ' t worry . I ' Ve got my credit card . You can pay me back later .
Thanks ! Now I don ' t need to come back to the shop a second time .
Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ?
Next left then right ? OK .
Probably two days . My wife will join me tomorrow . Then we will decide when to leave for Seattle .
Would you sign the register , PLS ?
By the way , does my room have a private bath ?
Certainly , every room in this hotel has a private bath .
Does my room have twin beds or a double ? I prefer a room with twin beds .
Your room has twin beds , Mr . Lee . It also has a view . I am sure you will like it . This is your key . It's on the eighth floor room 801 . The elevator's over there .
Thank you . One more thing , where is your restaurant ?
The restaurant is on the second floor . We also have a cafeteria on the top floor . If you would like something to drink , you can either call room service or come down here . The bar is right behind the lobby .
Thank you , you are very kind !
You are welcome !
Oh yeah . The big napkin goes on my lap .
Let's look at our menus .
Cindy , help me order because I'm still not very familiar with American cooking .
Well , we order appetizers first and then entrees .
From 200 to 800 .
I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ?
No problem .
What do you think ?
I love that shirt on you .
What about the jeans ?
They don't really fit you right .
I don't think so either .
That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though .
Well , I'll just buy the shirt .
That would be a good idea .
Where would you like him to come ?
To the front desk .
Just a moment , please .
Yes , I am really excited .
That's great . Congratulations .
I appreciate that .
You have no idea how happy I am for you .
For real ?
I believe you were the best choice for that promotion . I really do .
Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ?
Demographics say an average age of 28 . 7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year .
Oh , I like the music on your radio . It's nice .
Thank you ! I always tune to this program when driving . So what's your favorite program ?
I like Winner's English very mush . You know the Beijing Olympic Games is right around the corner . We should learn English Well . It's on FM 96 . 6 , China Business Radio . You can get it on your radio too .
But I don't speak English at all .
That's OK . The program is especially for the beginners like us .
Really ? When is it on ?
It begins at 6:40 every morning , and it goes for 20 minutes .
Thank you so much . I'll try and catch that .
The radio has brought us lots of convenience .
Yes , I can also learn about the traffic condition through it .
With the development of the society and technology , radio is nearly everywhere .
So we should take the advantage of it .
Does the 7th floor belong to our company too ?
Yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building .
It ' s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ?
Yes , at the end of the hall .
I can give you a reservation on flight No CZ 387 on July 22nd .
What about the fight schedule ?
It departs at 12:10 and arrives at 15:10 next day .
Is it a non-stop flight ?
Yes .
Sounds good . I'd like to take this flight .
Would you prefer first class or economy class ?
Economy class .
And your name , please ?
Edward Smith .
Mr . Smith , you can get things fixed through our agencies in Guangzhou . Do remember to bring your passport with you .
Yes , many thanks . Goodbye .
Bye .
Of course . If there is anything wrong with them , you can come back and show me the guarantee of quality , and then you will surely get free service .
I ' ll take them .
No , it just itches a lot .
I have openings on Tuesday or Wednesday . Which would be best for you ?
I need an appointment on Tuesday .
Fine , I am putting you down for 9
I would like to see Dr . Jones .
I can schedule you with him with no problem . We look forward to seeing you .
I'd like to have further education . Now I am studying for my doctorate .
Will you get any kind of scholarship ?
Yes . The school has provided me with full scholarship and that will be enough to support myself .
Then , is the machine broken or ...
Oh yes , I see the sign , thank you .
I'm sorry , sir . I can't interrupt her . I'm sure she won't be very long .
How long do you think she'll be ?
I really can't say how long she'll be .
Can I leave a message , please ?
Yes , certainly .
Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ?
Yes , sir . I'll ring her on an inside line if you like .
Thank you very much .
What symptoms does she have ?
Fever and a bad cough .
I see . Don't worry , just a common cold .
What kind of medicine does she need ?
Patulin will be enough .
How many pills for each time ?
Nine pills per day , and three pills after each meal .
Thank you very much .
It's my pleasure .
Our summer season ended in September . So the discount will be 40 % . That ' s a good deal . Would you prefer rooms with a front view or rear view ?
Front view , please .
What date and time will you be checking in ?
October 25th around 2:00 in the afternoon .
We need you to send a deposit for 1/3 of the bill . You can send the check , or you can use the credit card .
Ok . I ' ll send a check .
Could you tell me your name , address and phone number , please ?
Sure . My name is Anderson . My address is 109 Ferguson East , Holton . And my phone number is 309 789 1267 .
Thanks .
No problem , we can accept any denomination . How much would you like to exchange today ?
Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ?
It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7 . 45RMB . If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7 . 35 . Will that be all right ?
I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow !
I've got a fever and a very sore throat .
Well , you sound ill over the phone .
Yes . I have to stay in bed today , but I'll be able to come tomorrow .
That's all right . Have a good rest until you feel well enough .
Thank you , Mr . Smith . Goodbye .
Goodbye , Lucy .
There is no hot water , the bedroom has a broken window , and there are rats in the kitchen .
You know , no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before .
You are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment .
I will fix these problems when I get around to it .
I will be withholding my rent check this Friday unless these problems are addressed immediately .
You can ' t do that ! It ' s illegal !
Ok . I ' ll take it .
Where would you like to sit ?
Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes .
Certainly .
Can you tell me how much it will cost to send a package to Colombia ? Also , I what to know how long it will take .
Do you have the package with you ? I would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost .
Do you insure package ?
Yes . All you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for .
Is there a way that I can be sure that the people in South america receive my package ?
The post office rarely loses package . You can , however , request a rectum receipt .
One last question-what are your hours ?
We open at eight-thirty in the morning and close at five-thirty in the afternoon .
Thank you , you helped me a lot .
Certainly , hold on .
Thanks .
Not at all . I don't know what's dutiable . Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use ?
NO . You don't have to pay duty on personal belongings .
Thank you .
$ 600 .
Does that include the insurance ?
Of course .
Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
Oh yes , and fruits . I love fruits very much .
What do you like to drink ?
Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea .
Whatever would you like to drink ?
I drink a lot of milk . I drink milk almost every day .
How often do you exercise ?
Well , I walk every day .
It's a good diet and a regular exercise .
Yes , quite right .
Did this just come on suddenly ?
I felt OK until an hour or so ago , and then I just doubled over .
Have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently ?
No , and I don ' t usually get a lot of stomachaches .
We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is .
I think that that is the best way to figure out what is causing this . Thank you .
Till 5:30 .
It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .
We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .
Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .
If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?
We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi .
I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .
Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .
It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .
Thanks , that was nice of you .
See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !
How long did it take you to do the tiling .
As I hadn ' t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether .
I think you ' Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ?
You ' ll be lucky ! However , I ' ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself .
Let ' s get both . We need some coffee too . Is that on your list ?
Yes , it is . Here ' s my list . Is there anything that I ' Ve forgotten ?
I think you ' Ve got everything . I want to got some chocolate and some cheese .
What kind of cheese do you want .
I ' m not sure . I ' ll decide at the cheese counter , when I can see what they have . Have we got enough money ?
We don ' t have enough cash , so I ' ll take my credit card and we can pay with that . Where are the car keys ?
I ' Ve got them there . Shall I drive ?
That is to say , 10000 sets for the one of white-collar and 5000 for men's jackets .
In that case , our offer for the white-collar series is US $ 200 , and the other is US $ 300 per set .
Do you quote CIF or FOB ?
We usually quote on a CIF basis and a commission of five percent for you . You will find our price is most competitive .
What are your terms of payment ?
Letter of credit at sight .
Another question . Could you tell me the earliest possible time of shipment ?
Within a month after your letter of credit reaches us .
Well , I got all the point . All the decision will be made since I get the approval from my supervisor .
OK ! I expect you to accept our general terms and conditions of trade . We believe that through our cooperation , large transactions will be brought to speedy conclusion .
I'll get him one of those little dogs .
One that won't grow up too big .
And eat too much .
Do you know which one he would like ?
Oh , yes , I took him there yesterday . He showed me one that he really liked .
I bet you had to drag him away .
He wanted to take it home yesterday .
I wonder what he'll name it .
How soon can you begin working for us ?
I need about two to three weeks for necessary formalities . I will quit then transfer to your company .
Our special tonight is lobster .
Thank you , but I prefer the fish .
Perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb .
No , I like the fish .
What ever you say ?
That ' s great . Can you do it anywhere ?
No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
So , what programs do you have on your laptop ?
I ' Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs .
I know you are keen on photography . It ' s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at a
It ' s wonderful , isn ' t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I took recently ?
I ' m a nurse . What do you do in your free time ?
I like to play piano , go bowling and chat with my friends . And you ?
I like to hang out with my friends , play games and go swimming .
Would you like to go out some time ?
Sure , that ' d be great . Where would you like to go ?
Anywhere with you .
Aren ' t you sweet .
Fortunately for you , you don't . Next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
That's good advice .
Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
Are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
Let me see here ... yes , there's one left .
Ok . I'll take that one then .
Alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
I like to travel light so I just have this one .
If that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?
Yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ?
You're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . Here's your boarding pass . Enjoy your flight !
How would your friends or colleagues describe you ?
They say Mr . Sun is a friendly , sensitive , caring and determined person .
What personality do you admire ?
I admire a person who is honest , flexible and easy-going .
How do you get along with others ?
I get on well with others .
What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ?
Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into .
So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?
Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .
Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will .
After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ' m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice .
We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home .
Do you need to be located in a particular school district ?
It doesn ' t matter , as we do not have any children .
Is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ?
In a perfect world , we would like a home with a view of the lake .
Thank you for all of the information . I will help you find the perfect house for you .
Either in the overhead compartment or underneath the seat .
Everyone's attention , please . We are going to take off . Please fasten your belts .
Will you let me know where to get off ?
Certainly . Four more stop after this . I'll call out the stops .
Thank you .
OK ! I've noted it down . And any others ?
Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city .
I'll tell them .
Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor .
Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery .
Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you .
I think so . Bye !
Bye !
Shall we do some jogging ?
OK .
I feel well now .
Yes , some exercise is necessary for us .
Quite right .
I don't know how to make that .
All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef .
That sounds fairly simple , but how do I cook it ?
The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice .
What's next ?
Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it .
What's the next thing I need to do ?
Then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy .
Usually about two month .
That's too long . How long does it take to reach Taiwan by airmail ?
About ten days .
Then how much is that by airmail ?
Let me see . It ' s 57 dollars , 20 cents , including tax .
That's a little bit expensive .
Although it's expensive to send it by airmail , it's quicker and safer than by sea .
I guess I have to send it by airmail .
Do you want to ensure the contents , Miss ?
Yes , please .
Please fill out this form , also please write the value of the items in this space .
OK .
Well , if it breaks down again tomorrow , I'll definitely buy a new one .
Buy them now though , or they might not still be here tomorrow .
Good idea , especially at this price .
But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity . And anyway , I ' m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example . they have 1 . 4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .
Come on , son , you ' re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .
Fine , then ! If that ' s the way you feel , so be it . But you ' re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ' m going to go hit up Mum for the cash .
Oh , I forgot about it .
It's four o'clock in the morning in Chicago now , but it's time to go to bed in Shanghai .
Don't think so much . Take a good sleep and you'll feel better soon .
So , what do you feel like eating then ?
How about some burgers ?
I already had a burger yesterday .
What are we going to do ?
We can just each get what we want to get .
That sounds like a plan .
Do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ?
I think they sell both at the cafeteria .
Five hundred yuan .
Does that include hotels and meals ?
Oh , yes , and admission tickets for places of interest as well .
That sounds reasonable . What about the five-day flying journey ? How much is that ?
Eight hundred and fifty yuan .
Covering all expenses ?
Yes . But there is no half fare for children . They must pay full fare .
What ' s a cabinet ?
This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ' s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
Can any mp make a law ?
Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law .
I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ' s . most mp ' s vote the way their party wants them to .
How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Voters who often change the party they vote for are Calle
The 10th ? I'm sorry , but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th . Could you have the suit ready by the 8th , or at the latest , the 9th ?
Well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . But in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . How about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ?
That's fine , thank you .
May I try it ?
Sure .
It's very smooth . I'll take it .
Cash or charge ?
Charge , please .
Oh , thanks all the same .
Not at all . You can ask the policeman over there .
We are out at the moment . May I suggest some rye bread ?
Sure that sounds good . Do you have any cakes ?
We have various birthday cakes and also ice cream cakes .
I'll just take a cheesecake .
Will that be all ?
Yes .
Your total is forty three dollars and twenty cents .
I'm sorry , Mrs Li , Mr Brown is now in a meeting . May I have your number , and ask him to call you back later ?
I'm afraid Mr Wilson would like to speak to Mr Brown right now . He ' s got an urgent matter to discuss with Mr Brown without delay .
Ok , then would you please hold the line ? Mr Li , the line is through , Mr Brown is ready answering the call , go ahead .
Thank you for your assistance , Mr Bush .
You are welcome .
I see . Well , consulting is a little different .
I'm a quick leamer , Mr . Jenkins .
Umm hmm . Do you have a diver's license ?
Yes , and I'm a very good driver .
Fine . We provide a company car for our consultants .
Do I have to travel a lot ?
Oh yes-five days a week . You have to visit customers all over the territory .
But how will I get to know the products ?
You'll have to attend a three-week course . If you do well , the job is yours .
How much is the salary ?
Starting salary is $ 150 a week-plus commissions , of course .
How much commission do your consultants get ?
Five percent .
Well , I'm very interested in the job .
Fine . The next course starts a week from tomorrow .
Thank you .
Good luck to you .
Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?
Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout .
This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ?
I am still waiting for their call .
Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward .
OK , sir , wait a minute .
I'm sorry but 5 of these notes seem to be counterfeit . Look at this watermark , do you see it ?
It does look a little strange , I didn't notice that before .
But I saw a red car always parking here before .
Oh , we've just repainted our car . It was red .
Maybe . But the car of this space has a broken rearview mirror on the left .
Yeah . It used to . We got that fixed yesterday too .
Could you wait for a minute , sir ? I'd like to have a check .
Sure , go ahead .
Sorry , sir , my mistake . This is your parking space .
That's all right . It's not your fault .
I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhausted , but I can't sleep .
All right , ma'am . I'll check and tell them to be quiet .
If next room is still noisy , could you give me a different room , please ?
What a shame ! You should have showed yourself to them !
It doesn't matter . I'll try other companies .
I suggest you hunt for a job on the Internet .
On the Internet ? I've never heard of it .
It's very convenient and it has become popular recently .
Is that safe ?
Of course , if you log on some standard websites .
Thank you for your advice . I'll have a try .
I thought it was " the same day " service . Anyway , please do hurry .
I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock .
Well , then , would you send it to Japan , please ?
Yes , we'll do so .
I'm afraid not . He's gone for the rest of the day .
Is there anywhere I can reach him ?
I don't believe so . He's going out of town on business . May I take a message ?
I have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , but I'm afraid I can't make it .
Would you care to make another appointment ?
Unfortunately , I'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and I may be gone for several days .
I see . I can tell Mr . Thomas that you phoned .
Thank you .
Bye-bye .
I'm sorry sir , but we are fully booked tonight until eight .
In that case , eight o'clock is fine .
Very well , and how many people will attend tonight ?
Four people .
Lastly , may I please know what name I should make the reservation under ?
Mark .
We learnt about vegetables and meat at school . But I never see the real thing .
Wow , that's something new . Let's go ! What's this , honey ?
Er , is it cabbage ?
Cabbage ? Is that what they teach at school now ? OK , honey , it's spinage .
Yeah , I know , this is Popeye's favorite food .
There we go .
Mom , come here . I know this , it is carrot , am I right ?
Bingo ! It's dark outside , Let's hurry up .
I ' m not too worried about it . I always seem to find something .
So you must be an extravert ?
Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them .
What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ?
A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment .
Don't you consider it a hard work ?
Hard but interesting , I think .
Have you any experience as a tourist guide ?
Yes , I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University .
Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English ?
Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well .
Yes , that is big enough , but it's too heavy for me .
Okay , we have the same thing in aluminum .
Oh , this is nice and light . But it has an aluminum handle .
Try this one . Same aluminum pan , but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle .
Oh , yes . This is very nice . I'll take this one .
That's a good choice . How do you want to pay for it ?
Cash . Oh , I almost forgot . I need a lid , too .
I'm so sorry . A lid comes with the pan . Here it is .
Goodbye , Randy . Take care .
I'm sorry , Sir , the full procedure can take up to 7 days to process everything .
7 days ! What am I supposed to do for money until then ?
If you bring some ID with you , it's possible for you to make a withdrawal over the counter if you need to . But unfortunately , without your new card you cannot use the ATM , so all withdrawals must be made within working hours .
Flight CA216 to Chengdu .
Yes , it's true . It has been delayed .
Could you please tell me why ?
Yes , of course . The delay is due to heavy rain .
How long will the delay be ? Do you have any further information about it ?
I am sorry , we don't know the extent of the delay at present . But according to the latest weather forecast , there will be a change in weather soon .
We have to wait . Well , is it possible for the rain to stop before noon ?
It's hard to say . Weather is so changeable in the summer . Please listen to the latest announcement about your flight .
Yes , I will . Thanks a lot . Bye !
Bye
Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas .
I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails .
So you have to open all the envelopes .
Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly .
Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas .
Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him . He loves " The King . "
I'll put the song at the front of the list .
Yes , and it's extremely simple . All you need to do is make a Network Settlement Agreement with us .
have you ever had a dog ?
when I was little , we had a few domestic dogs at home .
they always say that dogs are a man's best friends . do you think that's true ?
definitely . rich or poor , dogs always love their masters .
how about cats ? Have you ever had one for a pet ?
i had one a few months ago , but she ended up running away .
how did that happen ?
she left through a window that was open one night and never returned .
you must have been devastated !
i was pretty sad . i still hope that she'll return some day !
I hope she does . Do you think you'll ever get another pet ?
I think I will . It's difficult to feel longly when you have a pet around .
i hope your cat finds its way back home .
i do , too .
Of course , I will .
Do you have anything else I can have instead ?
Well sir , yes . How about this stew ? We can serve you at once .
I ' ll take this stew then .
You get five paid sick days .
Any other benefits ?
Yes , we have an excellent retirement plan and medical insurance as well .
Great . Thanks so much for your time .
We ' ll contact you soon , Ted . Thanks for coming in .
Is there anything I should do ?
You'd better have a good rest for a week . Be sure to have regular meals . Stay away from alcohol . Give up smoking at least a little while .
Should I take some medicine ?
Yes . I'm going to give you some . Take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . For that one , two tablets . And remember to come to the out patient department for a consultation in two weeks , please .
It's very kind of you .
You're welcome . We wish you a speedy recovery . Goodbye .
we can buy a three-liter bottle . It works out cheaper per liter . We should buy a packet of butter and a few pints of milk too .
I ' d like to get a jar of strawberry jam and a bottle of tomato ketchup . Do we need any meat ?
I think we should get half a kilo of minced beef and a few pork chops .
Ok . Let ' s not forget fruit and vegetables . We need a bunch of bananas , a kilo of tomatoes and a bag of potatoes .
We should also get a tube of toothpaste and a bar of soap . Let ' s get a tub of ice cream too . We can treat ourselves .
Ok . We should get a few tins of tuna . Anything else ?
I ' d like a few cans of coke . We also need a dozen eggs and half a dozen sausages .
let ' s get a chunk of cheese too . Is that everything .
I think so . I ' Ve got the shopping list , so let ' s go .
What a pity .
You got lost . You're kidding !
No . We took a wrong turn somewhere . And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions . But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost .
You could have called .
I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were .
You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ?
Guess where we ended up .
I don't know . Where ?
When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield .
Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ?
I don't know . The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
I know it is . I don't know how it happened .
Hmm , maybe I do .
What ?
Maybe I have an idea how it happened .
How ?
You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road .
Oh , that's what you think , huh ?
I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .
I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % .
I ' m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ?
We've already cut down our price to cost level .
Is that all ?
Yes , this is the best we can do .
I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered .
yes , we accept all major credit cards .
and how about Internet access ?
there's free Internet access in the lobby .
is it available in the rooms ?
Unfortunately not .
that's OK . Is breakfast included ?
yes , breakfast is included and parking is available .
fantastic . Thank you very much .
you're welcome . And we have 24 hour reception . Please don't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions .
What's your nationality ?
American .
What's your relationship with the victim ?
I don't know him .
Why did you attack the victim ?
Because he beat me first when I tried to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away .
How many times did you stab the victim ?
I stabbed his belly three times .
Did you know hat your actions might cause serous injuries or death ?
I knew , but I couldn't control myself .
Was it your intention to kill the victim ?
No . I didn't kill him on purpose , madam . It's him who caused the incident . I need to see my attorney .
OK . Give me his number and we'll contact him .
Consider yourself lucky .
What are all the symptoms ?
Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water .
That doesn't sound good .
No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ?
Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family .
Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol .
I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body .
That's pretty bad .
But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah .
That sounds fine . Please give me your name and phone numbers . I ' ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . It will most likely be in a couple of days . Is it all right for you ?
Yes , my name is Brian and my phone number is 5294870 .
Thank you .
I ' m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time !
I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ' t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures .
I ' m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP !
Are there any other forms that I need to fill out ?
You will need to fill out a Continued Claim Form every two weeks .
What information will I need to provide on that form ?
They will need to know where you worked and how much money you made .
Are there any other questions on the form ?
Basically , they want to know that you were available for work and not sick .
Peter , if you don't turn off your computer , then I won't allow you to play it again starting next week .
Why don't you make some corn ?
How would you like the corn ?
I don't understand what you mean .
Do you want it boiled , grilled , or microwaved ?
Why don't you grill it ?
That's how you want it ?
Yeah , that sounds delicious .
Okay , I'll grill some corn then .
I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must .
I agree . They're very lovely , especially " Huan Huan " .
is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ?
the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive .
oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ?
I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now .
any other ideas ?
there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts .
it all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have .
Well , except for one night , I enjoyed the hotel . And I loved New York , of course .
Thank you for your honesty . I assure you there will be no cockroaches next time .
I see .
And that'll be 10:15 p . m . Beijing time .
Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ' s not really a shock for me .
Good , as long as you understand that .
And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ?
Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month .
That sounds ideal .
See that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .
Hey , don't be so pathetic . It's a maximal sports show . What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ?
They are all very experienced and great skiers . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow in here ?
Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ?
Hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist .
Sorry . Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .
Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
It's possible . But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
It's a good thing . OK , let's go skiing .
Here we go .
They are all listed here on this sheet of paper .
Is it their home , office or cell phone numbers ?
Unless it ' s marked differently , it ' s their home numbers .
Alright . What if I can ' t get a hold of them by phone ?
Then , you should e-mail them with the information .
Where can I find their e-mail addresses ?
They should have then listed on their resumes .
And if there aren ' t any e-mail addresses ?
Then send them a SMS on their cell phone .
Ok . That sounds easy enough . Have you called any of them yet ?
Yes . I called the first three people on the list , but they didn ' t pick up .
Did you leave a voice message ?
I left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list .
I see . What did you tell her ?
I told her that she should call me back at my office number .
Ok , so , maybe I should call her again .
Yes , that sounds like a good idea . She might not get the other message in time .
One more question . It looks like some of these numbers are long-distance . Do you have a calling card that I can use to get through to them ?
Sure . You can use this one . The pin number is written on the back of the card .
Alright . Thanks a lot . Don ' t worry . I ' ll take care of it .
Great work . I ' m off for the weekend ! See you on Monday .
See you .
OK , and when shall I bring it here ?
About seven thirty . By the way , could you also bring me tomorrow's papers ?
Of course , sir .
Okay . I ' ll send someone to deliver it for you tomorrow .
Thank you .
No problem .
Great .
Is it good ?
Sure . It's a most popular dish .
I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together .
We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ?
What kind do you have ?
We have French and Thousand Island .
Make it Thousand Island .
Hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! Is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ?
Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake .
What do you recommend we do ?
I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible .
I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now .
I ' Ve never used one before .
I can help you figure it out .
What do I have to do ?
Slide your card into the machine .
Then what ?
You need to type your PIN in .
What do I have to do next ?
Click on whichever option you want , and you ' re done .
Our Company is moving overseas and I wish to stay in the United States .
What are you best at ?
I am good at organizing systems that have been having problems .
What is your biggest challenge in terms of skills ?
I don ' t like to sit around and so like to always find things to do to keep myself busy .
That is good to hear !
Thank you . Have a pleasant stay .
Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ?
Well , uh ... I ' m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ?
Do you mind if I sit down ?
Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ?
I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ?
Yes . But why should you want to do that ?
Do you mind if I speak frankly ?
Not at all . Go ahead .
Well . You see , I don ' t like the office . I don ' t like the staff . And I ' m afraid of you . And I don ' t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ?
Yes . I ' d be delighted if you did .
I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen ' s Boutique . I didn ' t know I could get it cheaper somewhere else .
Of course ! Everything at Helen ' s is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn ' t you shop around ?
I don ' t know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive .
Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat .
How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ?
Yeah , are they easy to look after ?
Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything .
Sure here it is .
Good . Now just complete this form .
Would you mind taking the necklace with you , or leaving it at the safe deposit box ?
Well , don't bother . I'll take it with me . Will that be all right ?
Thank you , sir . Here is your tag . This cloakroom is open till 11:00 p . m . , could you pick it up by then ?
Sure . thank you .
Is there anything I should do ?
No , nothing . It's thoughtful of you to call me again .
Thank you . Please call me at any time if you have any questions .
Ok , I will . Do you have any question ?
No , thank you . Goodbye .
Goodbye .
Mom , the water is boiling !
Honey , just turn down the stove .
How nice ! I can see you are busying packing . I'm sorry to interrupt you .
That's all right . I'm almost finished . Do you need my help ?
Yes , could you please go over this for me ? and see if there is any mistake in it ?
Oh . all right I'll read it soon .
Excuse me for taking your time .
It's nothing Navy .
Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .
Have you decided ?
Yes . I want to get a better job .
Could you tell me why you want to quit ?
I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?
I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .
OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
Thank you so much for your advice .
And every best wish for your new job .
Thank you .
Robert . Philips Robert .
Yes , I am a volunteer for the campaign .
I am very impressed .
I feel that history is about to be made , and I want to be a part of it .
That is very nice of you .
Will you be voting ?
Yes , I am going to vote .
Make sure you make it to your polling place early on Election Day .
Thank you and good luck .
OK . Now lean back a little and keep still . I'm going to shave your face .
Regular is $ 1 . 15 , Super is $ 1 . 25 and Premium is $ 1 . 39 .
Just fill it up with Regular , Unleaded , please .
Do you want me to check the tires and the fluids ?
Yes , I would . Thanks a lot .
I would love to see it .
Are you free today at around 6 p . m . ?
Yes , I will be able to make it then .
Well , I'll see you at 6 p . m . Do you know how to get there ?
I used to live in that area .
I'll give you an application form when I see you .
That sounds good . Do I need to bring anything ?
No . Just bring yourself .
That sounds very reasonable .
It's the most important thing to me .
If you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ?
That obviously depends on how things go - - whether I'm suited to the firm and the firm to me .
Tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them .
I want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . In order to achieve this goal , I just want to work step by step .
What is your long-range objective ?
I haven't thought it over at all .
What do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ?
I think the most important thing is the interest in the job .
Well , it's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . So , unfortunately you'll lose this 50 RIB . We'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
Walk ?
Thirty minutes in gym at lunch time .
Oh no .
Use the stairs , never the elevator .
Oh , dear .
And three times a week , you can either swim , play racketball , or hand ball .
Oh no .
OK , you can stop now . It ' s time for the dance class .
Dance class ! I don't know how .
You will .
Oh ...
So when's the next forty-four ? Will it be here soon ?
No , it won't .
So when will it be here then ?
Never .
Never ?
That's right . The number forty-four doesn't stop here any more . Its stop is round the corner .
How much is it ?
100 frances .
Mmm , it is reasonable . Look at this set of table wear , it is so beautiful !
We have a piece of table clothing to go with it . It is a brocade one with pretty stars .
This silver vase is a good ornament for the living room .
You are right .
I will take the tapestry , the set of table wear and the vase .
OK . Do you like these candles ? They are on sale now .
All right . I will take one .
Yes . I was only entering my PIN . I'm terrible at remembering it , I'm so forgetful , you see .
Mmmm ... and exactly how many times did you enter it , please ?
Maybe three times . As I said , I always forget it .
Ah ! Don't worry ; it's just a security measure . If someone uses a card and cannot get the right PIN after three attempts , the bank keeps the card in case it's stolen . Just contact the bank and we'll get it back to you .
Oh , I see . So if I call my branch they can sort everything out for me ?
Yes , they'll be happy to help . Believe me , it happens to many people .
I'd better try harder to memorise my PIN in future . Thanks .
Yes , I love to see the animal show .
I have never seen those before , but since you're so excited it should be good .
I'm sure you'll love it .
Okay , I will go and get some popcorn first .
What about the smaller components ?
They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory .
Well , I am how much will that cost ?
The pass is free .
I don't have to pay for anything ?
You'll only have to pay for the monthly sticker .
How much is the monthly sticker ?
It's $ 24 for each month .
I'll take the student bus pass .
Okay , I'll get you one .
Ok .
Yeah . Let me see if he'll do it , and I'll get back to you .
OK . Just keep in mind it has to be somebody who can get along with Elvin .
Don't sweat it . I know just the guy .
My polling place is at the park up the street .
Oh , yeah ?
Yeah , where is yours ?
I don ' t know .
How is it you don ' t know ?
The location of my polling place never came in the mail .
You can always just check online .
Let me go do that .
May I see the room ? I ' ll take this room . Is the rate for the room only ?
No , sir . The tax is included .
Anyway , do you have any change I can use for the bus ?
I don't have any .
I don't know how I'm going to get home .
Get a transfer from the bus driver .
How much is a transfer ?
It doesn't cost anything .
That's great ! Thanks for your help .
You know what ? Don't mention it .
An apartment ? Why ?
I'm going to try to find a place near the office .
Where are you living now ?
Out in the suburbs . It's a long trip to work every day .
How are you going to find an apartment ?
I'm going to buy a newspaper and check the classified ads .
Apartments in the city are expensive .
I know , but I'm going to enroll in a night school to take a course in business management .
I see . Thank you .
Yes , our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast-track system .
Shall I come in and collect it ?
Or we can send it to you . But if you would like to use it at the ATM , you'll need to wait for your PIN number .
Mmmm ... if I come in and collect it this afternoon , is there any way I could use it today ? Petty cash is getting low , so I need to draw some money .
As long as you bring your ID , etc , we can serve you over the counter . But you won't be able to use the ATM until your new PIN number arrives .
I see . Yes , that's fine . I'll be there at around 2:30 pm . See you later , and thanks .
I ' m afraid I can ' t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ' Ve received from other sources .
But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ' s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries .
I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ' s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ' t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ' t changed much over the years .
There ' s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ' s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price .
Well , we ' ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ' ll have to try , I suppose .
I have things to do .
Like what ?
Don't be nosey .
I'm not . I just want to know .
Well , it's really none of your business .
That's harsh .
I'm sorry , but I have to go .
Fine .
It ' s half past twelve .
When do you have lunch ?
From one to two .
What do you normally eat ?
We usually go to the cafeteria .
Oh , it ' s time to have lunch now .
let ' s go together .
I feel as if I am going to be sick to my stomach .
Perhaps you should get checked out at the Student Health Center before you go home .
I have some medicine at home that I could take .
Are you going to be OK to drive home , or would you like someone to go with you ?
Thank you , but my friend is in the library , and he can give me a ride home .
We hope that you are feeling better soon . E-mail me if you have any questions .
It sounds like it will be .
I really hope it doesn't get cold .
That would ruin things , I want to go so badly .
The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know .
That is true . The weather is constantly changing .
It would be nice if the weather would never change .
That would be great , then we could plan things sooner .
True . Predictable weather would make life easier .
I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ' t explained yet .
I ' m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong .
For example ?
Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics .
Yes . Such people don ' t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs .
Yes , that's right . Down here , at the bottom right hand corner to show that you agree to pay the printed amount .
I'll go back to the office and get it sorted and pop back later . Thanks , bye for now .
I've counted nine different cockroaches , and I accidentally stepped on another one .
Sir , we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel .
You dare to doubt me ?
I'm sorry , sir . Let me transfer you to my supervisor .
Daddy , you always arrange your schedule so tight on weekdays . You should have a rest on weekends .
What park do you want to go to ?
Daniel wants to go to the aquarium . While Mom wants to visit the Summer Palace .
Haven't we been these places already ?
Yeah . I don't agree with them , but I don't have a better choice .
What about the Olympic park ?
Right , ah . It is so close to our home . How come we've never thought of that ?
The Olympic Park has a small forest . It is fit for picnic .
Very well , Go ahead .
I want the one with the highest interest rate .
That would be our Savers Plus account . You must pay 10 000 yuan into your deposit account . In this way you can get 5 % dividend at the end of the year .
All right . I'II open this one .
Just fill out these forms , and I ' ll be with you in one second .
Thanks .
A highchair and car seat ! Wow Betty , thank you so much ! I really appreciate it !
One more from Carla .
A playpen and crib ! Thanks Carla ! This is just what I needed !
OK , that ' s all of them . No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ?
Umm . I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital !
Yeah . For five minutes , everything was half off . It was total chaos ...
Cool !
Grabbing , pushing and shoving ...
4 . 5 % , that's good . How much money do I have to keep in it to get that rate ?
You have to maintain a balance of $ 10,000 in the account or the rate drops to 3 % .
All right . I ' ll open one of those .
Just fill out these forms , and I ' ll be with you in one second .
Thanks .
It feels a little tight around the waist . Do you have a bigger one ?
I'm sorry . We don't have this color in your size . We have some green ones in your size . Would you please have a look at this green one ?
OK . How much does it cost ?
It's 486 yuan .
Well , may I leave a message ?
Yes , of course .
Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ?
Ok . Does he know your number ?
I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 .
13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on .
So , you're a serious coffee drinker .
Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted .
Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing . Everyone has to have something . For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ?
No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker .
Well , what would you like to talk to me about ?
I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .
I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it .
It is about the staff meetings . You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday .
Yes .
Well , I have been thinking about it . And I believe we could do things more efficiently here .
What do you suggest ?
The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week . We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation .
You mean because people have to go across town to get here .
Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road .
That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them .
I think they are important too . That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them .
I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that .
Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more .
Well .
I also think the meetings should be more focused . And I would be willing to take responsibility for that .
You mean you want to run the meetings ?
No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting . This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .
Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks .
I really think it would work . The meetings could be longer , and better organized .
I am not against the idea , Arnold . It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do . Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works .
Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it .
I will call the managers . Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this " new style . "
Of course .
They really smell fragrant . How much is a real sandalwood fan ?
The small ones are one hundred yuan for each . And the big ones are two hundred and thirty yuan .
I'll take two small ones and a big one .
What else are you interested in ?
I'm afraid not .
OK . Here you are .
There are a mouse and a camera .
Is that all ?
Yes . How much is it to send these things to Shanghai by regular delivery ?
It depends on the weight of these things . Generally speaking , we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram .
I see . Can you weigh them for me , please ?
Please go over there to weigh them .
OK . See you later .
Are you sure you weren't speeding ?
To be honest , I really wasn't .
What speed were you going ?
I was under the speed limit . I was going 35 , when the speed limit was 40 .
I'm just going to let you go , since the arresting officer isn't here .
What about my ticket ? Do I still need to pay ?
Don't worry about it .
I'm so glad for your help .
I have something important to do , can you fast the speed ?
Sure , I'll try my best . Here we are .
How much should I pay you ?
The reading on the meter is 15 yuan .
Here's 20 yuan , keep the change .
Thank you very much .
it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking .
I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children .
I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking .
all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty .
perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow .
I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them .
that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad .
you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking .
I am sure that document was filed .
Well , let me check again under a different heading .
Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files .
Maybe that's why I couldn't find it . All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V ' .
That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .
Not at all .
Very well . How long do you want the house ? All summer ?
No , not all summer . Just for six weeks .
I'm afraid I can only rent it for two months .
My holiday is only six weeks , but I think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks . Is the house in good condition ?
Yes , it is . It was just painted and it has all the modern conveniences .
I'm sure it will . So , we should be able to start moving the machinery in during week 34 . I'll confirm that date with our suppliers .
You seem to be a kind-hearted lady .
Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature .
Please tell me your weaknesses if you can .
I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection .
You need to take it at bedtime .
Should I take this medicine on an empty stomach ?
Don ' t mix alcohol with this medication , but you can take it with or without food .
What are the side effects of this medication ?
You might feel a little dizzy at first , but it should pass .
No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago . It must be other problems .
Well , I suppose it could be the gas .
No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday .
Perhaps it's the starter then ?
Yes , that's possible .
Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch .
While you ' re cleaning the cooker , I ' ll wipe the worktop . That was a great meat , by the way .
Actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it .
My pleasure ! This tea towel ' s a little ragged . Do you have another one ?
Yes . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out .
Keep it and use it as rag . You can clean your bicycle with it .
That much ! Would you mind letting me have a look at it ?
Not at all , sir . Here you are .
Thanks . Well , It seems to be right . How much is that in dollars , please ?
Just a moment , sir . I'll calculate that for you . It comes to 305 dollars and 52 cents at today's exchange rate .
I see . OK .
How would you like to make the payment ?
In cash , please . Here you are .
Thank you , sir ... Here is your change . Could you check it , please ? Thank you for choosing our hotel . I hope you enjoyed your stay .
By the way , please forward my mail to this address .
Certainly , sir . We hope you have a good trip .
How long I will stay with the company depends on whether the company and I are satisfied with each other .
What do you think of this industry's outlook in five years ?
I do believe this industry will be developed rapidly in 5 years time .
I started feeling kind of sick last night after dinner , but this morning the pain got really bad !
Have you eaten anything unusual lately ?
No , not that I remember .
We are going to take you to an emergency room right now .
I will feel better when I know what the problem is . Thank you for the drugs .
OK , I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon , but this suit is also very stained . I can ' t guarantee we can remove it completely .
Fine ! Can you also iron and starch this shirt ?
Certainly .
Great ! This is our secret ! If you see my wife , say nothing to her about this !
Oh , I think I'd like to take the monthly savings account then .
Would you fill out this form ?
OK . Here you are .
All right . And here's your deposit book .
Thank you . Goodbye .
Goodbye .
No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them .
It's E-A-K-I-N-S .
E-A-K-I-N-S . First name , Donald . And what's your present address , Mr . Eakins ?
It's 1446 Pine Street .
1446 Pine . That's in San Francisco , isn't it ?
Yes , it is .
We ' ll need a letter from your university and a financial statement from you .
Let's go to aisle 4 to pick up some pasta for tonight .
Great ! Pasta for dinner .
And let's get a loaf of bread at the bakery for breakfast .
Maybe we should get a shopping cart .
I'll put the shopping basket back .
We're in a very competitive environment . It's sink or saimin this market .
Better start swimming ! we've got to find a way to outsmart the other guys . I want a preliminarily strategic marketing plan on my desk by next Tuesday ... the competition never sleeps and neither should we .
OK , thanks for the order .
Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything .
Really ? You didn't find a wallet ?
No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ?
Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor . Has anyone sat at this table since we left ?
No . It's been empty the whole time .
Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened .
I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill . You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ?
No . My friend did .
Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ?
No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down . It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table .
Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home .
I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house . But what should I do ?
Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home . Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that .
Should I call the police ?
You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets .
Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home .
I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir .
Thanks for your help .
Please handle the items carefully .
Certainly .
We will pay by collect on delivery .
What about your accounts ?
Oh , it's a beautiful city . I think you'll like it .
Hey , I'm feeling much better already .
Sometimes if you don't think about it , that sick feeling will go away on its own .
Thanks . By the way , my name is Mary .
I'm Frank . Nice to meet you .
Thank you very much .
It ' s my honor .
Well , do you have any suggestions ?
Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ?
It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things .
Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
OK .
Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ?
Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job .
I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work .
OK , let's go .
Do you have anything else I can have instead ?
Well , yes . How about beef stew ? We can serve you at once .
I'll take beef stew , then .
Not at all .
It's a private garden .
How much would you like to change ?
1000 Yuan . Here you are .
Great ! What floor is pharmacy on ?
The fourth . I'll send the prescription down there so you can just pick it up on your way out .
Thank you !
I have cigarettes for my own use .
I think you'll have to pay some duty on these cigarettes because they exceed the quota . And this article is liable for duty .
How much duty should I pay ?
One hundred dollars .
Here is the money .
Just a moment . I'll make out your duty memo . ( Writing and giving the memo to Mr . Green ) Take it and pay the girl over there .
Thank you .
That ' s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients .
Yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . We can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . Of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking
That sounds great . Do you accept checks ?
I ' m sorry , sir , we don ' t . But we do accept all major credit cards .
I see . What can I do now ?
You can send a compressed one .
Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea .
Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
Thank you .
It's 10:00 P . M . And it's four o'clock in Los Angeles , right ?
Yes - four o'clock in the morning .
4:00 A . M . ? I'm really sorry .
That's OK . I'm awake now .
Well , let ' s put on some music . We ' re going to be stuck in this for a while .
All right , what do you want to listen to ?
How about some Beatles ?
Yeah , all right .
Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ' t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do .
But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ' m nearly 17 .
You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ' t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study .
What else I ' Ve got to do ? Join the army ?
Who knows ! That might come to later .
I want an aisle seat as close to the exit door as possible , please .
Very well . Do you have any bags to check ?
No , I just have this one small bag .
Here you are , seat 12c . Please go to gate 23 after passing through the security checkpoint .
Thank you .
Have a nice day .
You , too .
Oh , I see them . Some are doing Taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the Chinese Wushu .
A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China .
OK . I will take it .
When do you check in ? How long are you planning to stay ? Do you have any special requirements ?
I guess I am going to arrive at 9:00 in the morning and I would like to leave at 200 in the afternoon on Sunday . Please give me a room away from the elevator . I hate noises while I am sleeping .
OK . No problem .
Wait a minute . I made a phone call , but I never made a connection .
I know , sir . Those aren't telephone company charges . Those are hotel charges .
Isn't that a bit excessive ?
I'm sorry , sir . It's our policy .
OK . Here is the money .
Thank you . Welcome to our hotel again .
Certainly , you're welcome anytime .
See you later !
( after a while ) Good afternoon , Mrs . Smith . I called you just now .
Welcome ! Come in , please !
Yes .
This way please . Your room is upstairs ... Here it is .
Wonderful ! A modest , comfortable room . Ah , a beautiful window , through which I can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . How nice !
Yes , if you want to wash something , there is a separate lavatory room outside .
Excellent ! I like it ! When can I move in ?
Anytime you like .
OK .
Let me check your parcel number . Song Ping's parcel number should be CP 06230221 5 CN . Here is your parcel .
Thank you .
Not at all .
Does he have any other complaints ?
Three days ago , he began to cough , sneeze and have a running nose . Yesterday , he began to have a fever .
Have you taken his temperature ?
It was 38 ° C this morning and it was 39 ° C just now .
Let me examine him to see if there is any rash . No rash .
Is it serious ? Is it meningitis ?
No , it is not meningitis . Just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection .
Does he have to be admitted to hospital ?
No . No need for admission . I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . Then I will give you a prescription . The pink tablets are used for his fever . When his temperature is over 38 ° C , give him one tablet . The other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions . The white liquid is for the cold . Give the baby plenty of water to drink .
Thank you very much , doctor .
Everything you can see will be on sale .
I like the sound of that . I'll just come back next weekend .
The savings will be worth the short wait . See you next weekend .
Yes , I would . I need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , I love browsing through the latest paperbacks .
Me too . I need something to read on the flight to New York . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ' s books for her daughter .
I want to look at nelson Mandela ' s autobiography .
This is sure to be a worthwhile read .
All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ?
How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan .
I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days .
I bashed it against the chair in my room .
Does it hurt ?
A little , but not much .
Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ' ll take you to the doctor ' s after breakfast .
If I ' m better this afternoon , can I go to school ?
If you are better , but I doubt you will be .
Three or four days , perhaps longer .
Very good , sir . We will be expecting you next Monday , the 12th .
What ? How did that happen ?
They think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face .
Wow . What does his look like now ?
It looks pretty frightening . He doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . Most of his nose and chin are missing too .
What did he look like before his dog bit his face off ?
He was actually quite handsome . What a shame .
What's he going to do now ?
It said that he's hoping to get a face transplant , but until then , he's looking forward to Halloween so he isn't the only one wearing a mask .
Yes , a coffee would be nice , thank you .
Here you are . Ms . Stevens is ready for you now . I ' ll show you to her office , right this way .
No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it !
You said you received your card this morning , am I right ?
Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ?
Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons .
Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me .
I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country .
Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't ?
Yes . It is one of the Five Mountains .
I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ?
I'd love to .
OK , just fill in this application . You can sit over there . This brochure explains our services . We have free checking , and you will be given a debit card and on ATM card . There is no service
OK , I ' ll fill out the form and come right back .
My watch says ten past .
It ' s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight .
Are you sure half past seven ?
Positive . I ' ll put the radio on .
It ' s only seven o ' clock . Your watch is fast .
No , it isn ' t . It ' s stopped . I forgot to wind it up last night .
I could have stayed in bed for another half hour .
As a guest , sir , you pay nothing .
This sounds better every second . Now , when can I use the stations ?
If you want to swim , you can visit the gym any day between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m .
Oh , boy ! This is going to be great . I'm going to the gym right now !
I'm sure you'll enjoy your workout , sir . Everyone seems to like the swim stations .
So who has to stay behind ?
Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone .
Ok . I ' ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket !
Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ?
Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ?
I surely do . They must have had advanced machine in ancient China to do that .
No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .
Unbelievable ! I could never do that .
Would you tell me the rate per day for depositing my bag ?
Sure , madam . Only one dollar .
When does the cloakroom close ?
This cloakroom is open until 10 p . m .
Oh , dear ! I won't be back until about 11:30 tonight . Where can I pick up my bag ?
We will transfer your bag to the Lobby Floor Cloakroom . You may collect it there , madam .
I see . Thanks a lot .
You're welcome .
The cable will take less time for your account , in the meantime , the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one .
Well , I think the cable is better .
OK , please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary , your name and telephone .
All right . Here you are .
Everything is OK . The commission is 50 yuan .
Here you are . Thanks a lot .
Next Wednesday .
Why not , thank you . A little tea would be nice .
I see , and what about the keyboard ?
I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work .
I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages .
Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways .
Thank you . I won ' t let this promotion change me .
Nothing earlier ? I prefer flight at nine thirty .
I'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight .
No , exactly not
How about afternoon ?
Sounds not good . I won't take it .
It lies in perseverance .
Well . It's hard for me . I can't keep doing exercise .
You should have a try .
No , there isn't . They are all vacuumed .
I wonder how old these things are , thousands of years ?
Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time .
Hey , look at the three-leg cup . I've seen it on TV .
The bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless !
Yeah , it has no value at all . Who will use this cup today ?
Danny , priceless means so valuable that you can't put a price on it .
Oh , it does ?
Yes . I was a member of the basketball Society . I like playing basketball .
What extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ?
I sometimes played basketball and sometimes played football .
Thank you , but I cannot take all the credit . Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level .
How about the charge for the days you shared the room with your friend ?
Please add to my account .
The total for the eight days is five hundred sixty yuan .
OK . Here you are .
I know , it ' s a big one .
Why not go and find a porter ?
Good luck to us .
That's all right . Have a good day .
That ' s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand .
I know history is about to be made , and I would like to be a part of it .
That ' s fantastic .
Are you planning on voting ?
I ' m going to vote .
Go to your polling place early on Election Day .
I will . Good luck with your volunteering .
That will work out fine . Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best ?
We should probably have both .
Yes , that will work out fine . Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ ?
Maybe we could do both !
Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details .
Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
Looks good ! I ' ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ' t forget the syrup !
Yes . Since I entered college , I have been working at a fast food restaurant as a part-time waitress .
For how long ?
3 years .
Our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . Can you serve them in English ?
That's why I applied for this job . Now I am studying Hotel English in my college , and I am quite familiar with the western courtesy and restaurant etiquette . I am sure my public relation skills will leave a strong impression on your customers .
You must know our working hours are very long and overtime work is frequent .
I don't mind that .
I think I will give you a 3 months ' trial . The salary for this period is 800 yuan a month with no bonus . After that period if we both feel satisfied , a formal contract would be signed .
When am I supposed to start working ?
Next monday . Bring your resume and diploma with you .
Yes , I will . Thank you , Mr . White . Goodbye !
Goodbye !
I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives .
Sorry . You'd better get off for taking another taxi .
Yep . And there's real strawberry chunks in the coating .
Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either !
That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ?
Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner !
OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here .
How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ?
Barbie ? You know , I might be seven , but I'm not a girl .
Do you have a better plan ?
All right , all right .
Yes , but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible .
I thought you would be worried about it . So I rang Auckland last night . As you are our biggest customer , they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave Auckland next month .
Good , if you agree we'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then .
By all means .
Okay . Good night . See you at breakfast .
It won't work . I'm nowhere close to being tired .
I really don't care , just go to sleep .
What if I stay up and do something , until I get tired ?
You'll be up all night if I let you do that .
I'm going to get to sleep eventually .
You need to go to sleep now , so go to sleep .
Good night .
Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
I learned to negotiate from my mother . I thought I was pretty good at bargaining , but I had a problem the other day at Kimble's Department Store .
What happened ?
I wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . It was priced at forty dollars , so I started by offering the salesclerk thirty .
What ' s this one ?
That ' s Oolong tea -- it ' s a Cantonese tea .
Ok , I ' ll try that .
So , what's the problem ?
I need souvenirs !
You want some souvenirs !
Yes , yes . Souvenirs .
But , sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items .
That's not the same thing . If you buy hotel souvenirs , they have no sentimental value .
I understand , sir . I'll call housekeeping . You'll have your souvenirs shortly .
It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I'd like it better . This seems too light for winter . Do you think you could get me one ?
All right . I'll show you something darker . Do you like this one ?
It looks good . But can I try it on ?
Of course . Let me help you .
Thanks . It's comfortable . Well , how much is it , please ?
$ 280 .
Ok . I'll take it . Here's the money .
I can speak the language better than read and write .
Do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of English-speaking countries ?
I think so . I used to be an interpreter .
Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work ?
The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm .
I found mine at IKEA .
Are they expensive ?
Everything I got from IKEA cost me a couple thousand .
Is the furniture crafted well ?
The furniture isn't built cheap .
I'll pay the money , as long as I'm getting what I pay for .
You will feel comfortable paying the money .
Yes , sir . You're booked on Flight 201 , leaving in one hour .
Thank you .
Yes , I like the color . Can I try it on ?
Sure . The fitting room is on your right .
It fits well . I like it a lot . What do you think ?
You look pretty in red .
Oh , it ' s my favorite . How much is it ?
$ 29 . 99 .
Okay . I ' ll take it . Thank you very much for your help .
You ' re welcome .
Here you are .
Thanks . Which kind of medicine do you prefer , western medicine or traditional Chinese medicine ?
I ' d like to try traditional Chinese medicine . I heard it really works quite well if you know what you're doing .
All right . Yes , he does . The registration fee is 7 yuan , please .
Your company is developing so fast . Maybe later on I will plan to buy more .
That's great ! Thanks for your support . If any , please remember to call us . I am afraid I have to say goodbye now ! Bye , Mr . James !
Bye !
The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ?
You know , that is one of my favorites !
OK , I'll take one order of that .
You could choose another appetizer for half price to share .
Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings .
It's 1200 . Room service is available 24 hours a day .
Very good . Now , could you help me to adjust the air conditioning , please ? It's too hot in my room .
Yes , the control unit is on the wall next to the bathroom . Is 24 ° C all right ?
Yes , that's perfect . Another thing , if need more items for the mini-bar , which Number should I call ?
You should call the Housekeeping Department on 2300 . They will replace any stock for you immediately .
I see . So , is it possible to make international phone calls from my room ?
That's no problem . Just dial 9 to get an outside line , and then dial the number as usual .
Well , thanks a lot for your help .
No problem , sir . If there's anything else you need , you can find me at the desk by the elevator , or you can call housekeeping if I'm not there .
OK , goodbye .
Goodbye , sir .
Great . What floor is the pharmacy on ?
The fourth . I ' ll send the prescription down there , so you can just pick it up on your way out .
Thank you .
There are various magazines in the rack .
Give me the latest issue of ' National Geographic ' .
That's the top magazine in America and is popular with young people . OK . It is totally 30 dollars .
Here you are .
Have a nice trip .
No , I don ' t have any allergies that I know of .
Does this happen all the time or mostly when you are active ?
It happens a lot when I work out .
I am going to send you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma .
Thank you for your help , doctor .
Eve .
What's the expiration date on your card ?
It's July 16,2009 .
Where is your car now ?
It's on the west street , near Royal Hotel .
And which direction were you going ?
I was going west .
What is the make and model of your car ?
BMW 530 .
What color is it ?
It's red .
What's your licence plate number ?
SAY 201 .
All right , Madam . I'll have a tow truck there within 30 minutes .
And there are Cantonese cuisine and Kiangsu cuisine .. Most people like them .
What about any special Beijing dishes ?
There ' re Beijing roast duck .
OH , yes . I heard of a lot of about it . I like very much to try it . Where can I find it ?
You can find it in most restaurant . The best place certainly is Quanjude restaurant .
Is it near here ?
Not too near but not too far either . A taxi will take you there in fifteen minutes . the traffic is not too bad , I mean .
Well , thank you for your information . What ' s the name of that restaurant again ?
Let me write it down on a piece of paper for you . You can show to the taxi driver .
That ' s very kind of you . Thanks a lot .
OK . I will do that .
Thank you very much . Bye .
You're welcome . Bye .
Thank you .
I'm always at your service .
I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new .
I see . Do you want to work full-time or part-time ?
I would rather work full-time .
I'll make note of that . Now , what are your salary expectations ?
I am willing to negotiate , but I expect at least $ 40,000 a year .
To go , please .
That comes to four dollars and ten cents .
And can I have some ketchup , please ?
It's on the service counter over there . Please go to help yourself .
I sure do .
Would you like to transfer money from that account into your new one ?
That ' s fine .
How much would you like to transfer ?
Transfer $ 100 .
Give me a moment while I complete your transaction .
That ' s fine . Thank you .
I was pulled over for running a red light , but I never did .
Do you believe that the officer lied ?
There was a camera on the signal . So , he was obviously lying .
Your license plate was caught on camera ?
A picture of my license plate was never taken .
Since there is no picture of your license plate on record , I'm going to let you go .
Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me .
Well , I think you look nice today too .
Thanks . I found these new shoes earlier at the store .
I think that those are some really nice shoes . What kind are they ?
These are Chucks .
Your shoes look really nice . How much did you get them for ?
They only cost me about forty dollars .
I'm going to go get a pair for myself .
I ' m awfully sorry to hear that . I ' ll turn to it right away .
no , just occasionally
oh , i like this music very much , let's tango .
i'm afraid i can't dance well .
No , I don't risk it .
How about a delicious dessert then , with our compliment ?
I'm not keen on dessert as a habit . They are fattening .
I see , sir . I'm sure everything will be right next time you come .
Yes , you are right .
And you'd take some exercise every day .
Many thanks for your advice .
Cool !
Grabbing , pushing and shoving ...
I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ?
Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu .
Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today .
Yes . The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers .
So there will be many large companies in the personnel market , right ?
Yes , there are many famous corporations .
When will there be a job fair ?
Every Saturday and Sunday
Do I need to pay to go into the personnel market ?
No , it's free .
How about going there to have a look now ?
OK , let's go .
We do face a lot of challenges because there is still much uncertainty about the world economy . It's very important for us to strike a proper balance between investment in fixed assets and household consumption .
Thanks for your trust . Owing to my colleagues ' help , I've successfully completed my task .
You are very modest and diligent . The distribution of bonus derived from the performance evaluation . You deserve it .
Thank you very much . I will redouble my efforts in the future .
Really ? That's wonderful !
Outside or inside ?
Outside , on the sidewalk .
Hmm . It's very cold today . But I brought my jacket . Maybe it will be alright to wait .
The MYOMA is very popular . There will be a lot of people .
MYOMA ? What's that ?
Oh , sorry . It stands for the Museum of Modern Art . It's an acronym . M O M A MYOMA .
I see . Do you have any suggestions for other things we should do ?
I suggest you go to the Jewish Museum . It ' s not far from the Guggenheim , near Central Park . It is really very interesting . Also , there is a great museum of medieval European art further up north . It ' s called the Cloisters .
How can we get up there ?
You can take a bus .
But Larry says the neighborhoods in the north are dangerous .
Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
How much do you think the rent will be ?
I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
No need , sir .
OK .
I hope they will come out well . When should I pick them up ?
They will be ready at noon tomorrow . Each negative develops one print , right ?
Yes , it is . And develop them as glossy as possible .
No problem . Do you need another film ?
Yes , a roll of Kodak film please .
It is totally $ 20 including the deposit for films .
what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?
it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .
I see , so it's similar to global warming ?
they're related to one another , yes .
I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .
people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .
people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .
I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place .
What do you mean ?
Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .
But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .
Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .
I still think we should have a realtor . We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has
Of course we need a home inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .
So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?
It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .
And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?
Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .
Why ?
Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .
Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .
It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .
I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .
Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store .
We can complete a trade by email , electronic data interchange and smart cards , and so on .
What are the benefits of e-commerce ?
Firstly , it can overcome the geographic limitation . And secondly , e-commerce can lower the internal costs . And thirdly , people like us , can also open stores on Internet .
How things have changed now !
Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?
I don't know .
I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .
What do you mean ?
We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time . We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .
I have plenty of gas .
Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working . We can't just let the car run and run . If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .
So what can we do ?
Turn the lights off . Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . That will conserve the heat as long as possible .
Alright . That's a good idea .
I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .
Days ?
Yes , it happens . That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .
Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .
Probably we'll survive . But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .
Ok , but I'm taking your skateboard as collateral .
Fine ! I can't believe you don't trust me .
It's nothing personal , just business .
Tell me about it .
Not only is it affordable , but it comes with all the appliances .
What are the appliances .
It has an ice maker , water dispenser , and plenty of room on the inside .
I'd like to see it for myself .
Go right ahead .
I like what I see .
Are you sensitive to other things ?
Yes , things like seafood and penicillin-type drugs .
OK . Let me examine your nose . According to your case history and the examination , I believe that it's allergic rhinitis .
What useful treatment can you offer ?
I'll give you a series of specific skin tests . Then we'll know exactly what substances you're allergic to . Then I'll give you some causes of desensitization therapy .
Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired .
How long will it take us to get there ?
I think about ten minutes by bus .
It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain .
Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus .
Yes , of course .
Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ?
Ok . Does he know your number ?
I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 .
13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on .
I think you'll be very pleased with how well we duplicate your old card .
... Here you go
Thanks . Come back here next Wednesday to pick up your order , please .
I'm sorry , but can you give me a three-day turnaround ?
If you don't mind paying a little extra , it's absolutely no problem .
Yes . I told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession . But I thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only .
That ' s sex discrimination . When will you get the reply ?
In a couple of days , I was told .
Wish you good luck !
Thank you .
Is there something wrong with your meter ?
No . I am sure about that .
OK . Could you give me a receipt ?
Yes . This is your receipt .
I see . It's interesting that there is also a parrot in my English book . His mane is Polly .
Really ? A foreign parrot !
He can speak English , too .
Maybe you can teach Lulu some English words .
Lulu . Lulu . Say hello . hello . Oh , she is so smart . Good bird .
Thanks again .
Sounds reasonable . I will tell my boss about you agent application . Another question , what do you think is the minimum annual sales you can guarantee ?
To be on the safe side , and for garment of all materials , sizes , and styles , I think the amount will be 50,000 pieces a year .
Well . As our sole agency , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own .
No , certainly not .
I like this T-shirt . Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with it ?
Sure . We have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the T-shirt . Look at this section .
This one is good .
You have good taste . It is very much in style this year .
I'll take this one . How much are they ?
160 yuan .
Here you are .
Sorry .
It ' s all right . Where are you going ?
I wanted to see the White House .
Oh , well you don ' t want this bus , anyway . It goes to Georgetown .
Oh , no .
It ' s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A .
Oh , well thank you very much .
You ' re welcome .
That's OK . Is anything else recommended ?
Do you have any special request ?
I'd like to see some traditional arts .
So that means you are shopping for presents ?
Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends .
Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle .
Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut .
I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best .
You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale .
As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country .
Wow , you are the expert on it .
How many years of experience do you have ?
I have three years of teaching ESL and four years of teaching per-school children .
When did you get your TEFL certificate ?
I got my TEFL certificate three years ago .
Why do you want to teach at our school ?
Well , I ' Ve heard many good things about it . I also like teaching young children .
That ' s great . Can you speak Chinese ?
Yes , just a little .
Can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10:00 ?
I sure can .
Great . See you then .
... I am seeing someone . This is Yi-jun , my ...
Yes , you are always popular with everyone . and you look very pretty today .
Thanks , that's very kind of you to say . I hope my necklace goes with my dress , and they both make me look good I feel .
You look great , you are absolutely glowing .
Thanks , this is a fine party . We should have a drink together to celebrate your birthday
Then let's go to that store .
Not at all .
No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy
If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ?
That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like
Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?
I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children !
Have you made a reservation ?
Yes , we have .
That's OK .
I think so . I feel very hot .
Let's see . Yes . You ' Ve got quite a high temperature .
I've got an awful headache , too , and my throat hurts .
Hm ... I think you ' Ve got the flu .
Is it serious ?
No , not at all , but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine .
How often must I take it ?
Three times a day after meals .
Thank you , Doctor . Goodbye .
Oh , I see . Well , I ' ll give you my phone number and if you need a guide , please call me .
Thank you very much . That ' s very kind .
No , I don't . I've never had a bad one before .
When did it start ?
About four days ago .
Well , go home and rest in bed for two days , then you'll feel better .
Can you give me some medicine ? It's very painful .
Yes , I'll give you some pills . Take one a time and three times a day , and come back in three days . If you don't feel ...
Can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o ' clock ?
OK . I will be there .
Thank you for calling . Goodbye .
Bye .
7:30 PM at London-Chinese restaurant . I \ ' ll be at your place at seven to pick you up if you need a ride .
Yes , please , I'll need a ride . I'll be waiting for you then .
See you tomorrow at seven . Make sure your dress a little formally . I heard the restaurant is kind of upscale .
Thank you , see you then .
See you .
Here you are .
Just one thing before you go , could you please prepare your documents in accordance with the L / C within the validity period ?
No problem , I'll get on that right away . Thanks , bye .
Last week I was down to 60 kilos . This week I had one donut more . Now I'm up to 62 kilos .
Bruce By the way , can we have a table by the window ?
we ' ll try to arrange it , but I can ' t guarantee sir .
That ' s fine .
your table's ready , sir ? Please step this way .
Of course . In Europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service .
Is it the same in America ?
They do the work without charge to the importer .
It's part of their service , isn't it ?
Exactly .
Is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ?
No , you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment .
I see . By the way , how do we prove the ownership of our goods ?
You must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice .
I see . Thank you .
You are welcome .
So , we'd like to see some embroidery .
Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers .
Great ! I ' ll take it .
Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train !
I understand . Thank you very much !
Have a great trip .
Please come again .
Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it .
It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth .
I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results .
Really ? that's interesting !
Yeah . Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good .
OK , I'll give it a go .
That ' s fine . Thanks .
You ' re welcome . Could I have your name and phone number , please ?
Certainly . My name is Janet Smith , and my phone number is 610-555-1234 .
Very good , Ms . Smith . I have scheduled an appointment for you on Wednesday at 9:30 am .
Thank you very much .
You ' re welcome .
Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ' ll deposit one month ' s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ' s rent in advance . I understand that I ' ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs .
Yes . If you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out .
Can I pay you by check ?
Sure . A check will be fine .
Is there a laundry room in the basement ?
Yes .
Can I sign the lease right now ?
Well , it looks like you have . You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out . Can you just refill it once more ?
I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription . And this prescription has run out .
But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription .
Miss , I understand your problem . But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it . We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never .
But I have a prescription . I just need more of it .
A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law . You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor . It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens . But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry .
This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it .
Maybe that's true . I don't know . But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too .
I see myself in a management position .
I must have slept right through it .
Rise and shine ! Sleepyhead !
Just let me sleep five more minutes .
The early bird gets the worm .
I know , I know . But I don't want any worms .
Ha ! Ha ! If you don't make an effort now , later on it'll be a lot tougher for you .
Then , why didn't you do that ?
I don't know how much we can trust them . Do you have any ideas ?
Some of them , I think , are not good .
It doesn't taste good ?
No , I mean some of them are not clean enough .
That's my greatest concern . But how can you tell which one is clean ?
I judge by appearances .
I got it . I think it's worth trying .
It certainly is .
I'd like to try some kebab , roasted squid , and many different appealing things .
Don't try everything at one time , please .
I see . Thank you .
Well , I don ' t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio .
In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ' s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ' s a lot of weight !
It ' s not that much . Just watch ... I ' m ok ...
It's often windy in March . It's always warm in April and May , but it rains sometimes .
What's it like in summer ?
It's always hot in June , July and August . The sun shines every day .
Is it cold or warm in autumn ?
It's always warm in September and October . It's often cold in November and it rains sometimes .
Is it very cold in winter ?
It's often cold in December , January and February . It snows sometimes .
OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan .
Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away .
It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
But I don ' t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .
I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
I'm afraid not , sir . Generally we can , but you know how it is in the rush hour now .
I see . Here's the extra 5 $ for you if you can get me there on time .
All right . I'll do my best .
Oh . we made it . Thank you . How much do I own you ?
The reading on the kilometer is 12 $ .
Here's the money , keep the changes , please .
Do you need a receipt ?
No , thank you .
I think you'll find I'm worth that .
I can only offer you 110,000 Yuan a year . Raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance . Is that satisfactory ?
Yes , it is quite reasonable .
Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
What do you drink ?
Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
What do you drink ?
I can help you with that .
Explain to me how to use it .
Just put your card into the machine .
Now what do I do ?
Then you need to type in your PIN .
Now what ?
Just click on one of the choices they give you , and that ' s it .
I'll need to see your ID please .
Here you go .
Sorry about the inconvenience , you look so young . I had make sure you are over 21 years old .
Hmm , I guess on the 28th .
Okay , you ' re booked on American Airlines flight 710 , departing JFK at 6:40 p . m . on September 17th . Your return flight is flight 711 , departing London ' s Heathrow Airport at 11:15 a . m . on September 28th .
Sounds good . Thanks a lot .
It's our pleasure .
well I have been thinking about getting a newer car . I can't afford a brand new one .
Would you like to look at my cousin's car ?
Is it a four-door or a two-door ?
It's a coupe with a vinyl roof .
Does it have automatic transmission ? .
Yes , and it also has power steering , power brakes , and air conditioning .
I guess I might take a look at it .
My name is Du Tao , number 3 .
Pardon ?
Du Tao . D-U for Du and T-A - 0 for Tao .
Yes , Mr . Du , when were you born ?
I was born on January 1st , 1988 . I ' m 20 years old now .
Where do you live ?
I ' m living at Room 222 , Building 18 , N . P . U .
Can you leave me your phone number ?
Gladly , 8962105 2 .
Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
O . K . , O . K . , I ' ll go .
Good . You feel better after you do .
That's right . You should give it up , too . It ' s bad for your health .
Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying .
But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started . Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip !
What do you mean ? What are you talking about ?
I mean you couldn't give it up !
That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ?
Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out .
That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ?
Early in the New Year I guess .
I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent .
Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave .
Thank you , Mr . Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr . Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients .
Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed .
I will . Many thanks , Mr . Black .
Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on .
They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs .
All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality .
Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ?
This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac .
Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones .
OK , I will wrap them for you .
Take a few days off from work and don't wear yourself out .
Sure . It's my pleasure . I'd like to help you look for the missing keys .
It's very kind of you .
It's not a big deal . Hey , I found them .
Oh , thank God ! I don't know how to thank you , guys .
You're welcome .
Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration .
I think I'll try it .
We have three kinds of dressings for salad . Italian , French and Thousand Island . Which one would you like ?
French , please .
OK . Do you want to order something else ?
Milan Style Macaroni . Don't put sugar or salt on it , please .
I'll have our housekeeper come right away .
I'm sorry I was too tired to fall asleep .
When you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub .
Right . Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ?
I like the cool smell , too .
There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
I'll do my best .
Here's twenty dollars .
Do you have small bills ?
No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ?
Here is your receipt . Thank you .
Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel .
Right at the Hilton .
Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral .
The Cathedral ?
Yes . Then cross the road at the next traffic lights . The Peak Tram is straight ahead . You can't miss it .
That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ?
Yes . Why ?
Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down .
I need it delivered tomorrow . Will that be possible ?
What time exactly ?
I need it delivered at 12 o'clock .
We can have it to you at that time .
That's not a problem ?
We will deliver your mattress tomorrow at 12 o'clock .
That's great ! Thank you very much .
Good . Now the other eye .
Well , this one is worse .
Never mind , just read as far as you can .
I can only read the first three lines .
Yes , many people make that mistake .
Well , you can't blame them . It's a confusing ad .
You're right . Many ads are like that .
Well , as long as I'm here .
Just one second , and I'll give you the batteries that are on sale .
Oh , well , that might be a problem . I usually only sign one year leases .
Well , one year would be fine , too . I ' m not planning on leaving the area anytime soon .
Well , if it ' s not a problem . Then here you go .
Just let me look at it quickly .
Of course .
Looks like a standard lease .
Yeah , and don ' t worry about the security deposit . If everything ' s all right when you move out , you ' ll get it back .
O . K . Great . Just sign and date it here ?
Yes . Thanks . You can move your stuff in tomorrow .
Wonderful .
Yes , it ' s half price . It ' s supposed to be too large--that ' s the fashion .
I might get one too , but in a different color . I prefer light blue to white .
There . It looks great , don ' t you think ? I ' m going to get these jeans as well . I need a new pair . I ' m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter .
I ' m getting this beret ? Doesn ' t it look cool ? I ' d like to get some jeans too , but I don ' t have enough cash on me .
Don ' t worry . I ' Ve got my credit card . You can pay me back later .
Thanks ! Now I don ' t need to come back to the shop a second time .
Next left then right ? OK .
Would you sign the register , PLS ?
By the way , does my room have a private bath ?
Certainly , every room in this hotel has a private bath .
Does my room have twin beds or a double ? I prefer a room with twin beds .
Your room has twin beds , Mr . Lee . It also has a view . I am sure you will like it . This is your key . It's on the eighth floor room 801 . The elevator's over there .
Thank you . One more thing , where is your restaurant ?
The restaurant is on the second floor . We also have a cafeteria on the top floor . If you would like something to drink , you can either call room service or come down here . The bar is right behind the lobby .
Thank you , you are very kind !
You are welcome !
Let's look at our menus .
Cindy , help me order because I'm still not very familiar with American cooking .
Well , we order appetizers first and then entrees .
I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ?
No problem .
I love that shirt on you .
What about the jeans ?
They don't really fit you right .
I don't think so either .
That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though .
Well , I'll just buy the shirt .
That would be a good idea .
To the front desk .
Just a moment , please .
That's great . Congratulations .
I appreciate that .
You have no idea how happy I am for you .
For real ?
I believe you were the best choice for that promotion . I really do .
Demographics say an average age of 28 . 7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year .
Thank you ! I always tune to this program when driving . So what's your favorite program ?
I like Winner's English very mush . You know the Beijing Olympic Games is right around the corner . We should learn English Well . It's on FM 96 . 6 , China Business Radio . You can get it on your radio too .
But I don't speak English at all .
That's OK . The program is especially for the beginners like us .
Really ? When is it on ?
It begins at 6:40 every morning , and it goes for 20 minutes .
Thank you so much . I'll try and catch that .
The radio has brought us lots of convenience .
Yes , I can also learn about the traffic condition through it .
With the development of the society and technology , radio is nearly everywhere .
So we should take the advantage of it .
Yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building .
It ' s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ?
Yes , at the end of the hall .
What about the fight schedule ?
It departs at 12:10 and arrives at 15:10 next day .
Is it a non-stop flight ?
Yes .
Sounds good . I'd like to take this flight .
Would you prefer first class or economy class ?
Economy class .
And your name , please ?
Edward Smith .
Mr . Smith , you can get things fixed through our agencies in Guangzhou . Do remember to bring your passport with you .
Yes , many thanks . Goodbye .
Bye .
I ' ll take them .
I have openings on Tuesday or Wednesday . Which would be best for you ?
I need an appointment on Tuesday .
Fine , I am putting you down for 9
I would like to see Dr . Jones .
I can schedule you with him with no problem . We look forward to seeing you .
Will you get any kind of scholarship ?
Yes . The school has provided me with full scholarship and that will be enough to support myself .
How long do you think she'll be ?
I really can't say how long she'll be .
Can I leave a message , please ?
Yes , certainly .
Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ?
Yes , sir . I'll ring her on an inside line if you like .
Thank you very much .
Fever and a bad cough .
I see . Don't worry , just a common cold .
What kind of medicine does she need ?
Patulin will be enough .
How many pills for each time ?
Nine pills per day , and three pills after each meal .
Thank you very much .
It's my pleasure .
Front view , please .
What date and time will you be checking in ?
October 25th around 2:00 in the afternoon .
We need you to send a deposit for 1/3 of the bill . You can send the check , or you can use the credit card .
Ok . I ' ll send a check .
Could you tell me your name , address and phone number , please ?
Sure . My name is Anderson . My address is 109 Ferguson East , Holton . And my phone number is 309 789 1267 .
Thanks .
Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ?
It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7 . 45RMB . If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7 . 35 . Will that be all right ?
I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow !
Well , you sound ill over the phone .
Yes . I have to stay in bed today , but I'll be able to come tomorrow .
That's all right . Have a good rest until you feel well enough .
Thank you , Mr . Smith . Goodbye .
Goodbye , Lucy .
You know , no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before .
You are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment .
I will fix these problems when I get around to it .
I will be withholding my rent check this Friday unless these problems are addressed immediately .
You can ' t do that ! It ' s illegal !
Where would you like to sit ?
Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes .
Certainly .
Do you have the package with you ? I would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost .
Do you insure package ?
Yes . All you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for .
Is there a way that I can be sure that the people in South america receive my package ?
The post office rarely loses package . You can , however , request a rectum receipt .
One last question-what are your hours ?
We open at eight-thirty in the morning and close at five-thirty in the afternoon .
Thank you , you helped me a lot .
Thanks .
NO . You don't have to pay duty on personal belongings .
Thank you .
Does that include the insurance ?
Of course .
Oh yes , and fruits . I love fruits very much .
What do you like to drink ?
Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea .
Whatever would you like to drink ?
I drink a lot of milk . I drink milk almost every day .
How often do you exercise ?
Well , I walk every day .
It's a good diet and a regular exercise .
Yes , quite right .
I felt OK until an hour or so ago , and then I just doubled over .
Have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently ?
No , and I don ' t usually get a lot of stomachaches .
We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is .
I think that that is the best way to figure out what is causing this . Thank you .
We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .
Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .
If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?
We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi .
I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .
Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .
It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .
Thanks , that was nice of you .
See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !
As I hadn ' t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether .
I think you ' Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ?
You ' ll be lucky ! However , I ' ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself .
Yes , it is . Here ' s my list . Is there anything that I ' Ve forgotten ?
I think you ' Ve got everything . I want to got some chocolate and some cheese .
What kind of cheese do you want .
I ' m not sure . I ' ll decide at the cheese counter , when I can see what they have . Have we got enough money ?
We don ' t have enough cash , so I ' ll take my credit card and we can pay with that . Where are the car keys ?
I ' Ve got them there . Shall I drive ?
In that case , our offer for the white-collar series is US $ 200 , and the other is US $ 300 per set .
Do you quote CIF or FOB ?
We usually quote on a CIF basis and a commission of five percent for you . You will find our price is most competitive .
What are your terms of payment ?
Letter of credit at sight .
Another question . Could you tell me the earliest possible time of shipment ?
Within a month after your letter of credit reaches us .
Well , I got all the point . All the decision will be made since I get the approval from my supervisor .
OK ! I expect you to accept our general terms and conditions of trade . We believe that through our cooperation , large transactions will be brought to speedy conclusion .
One that won't grow up too big .
And eat too much .
Do you know which one he would like ?
Oh , yes , I took him there yesterday . He showed me one that he really liked .
I bet you had to drag him away .
He wanted to take it home yesterday .
I wonder what he'll name it .
I need about two to three weeks for necessary formalities . I will quit then transfer to your company .
Thank you , but I prefer the fish .
Perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb .
No , I like the fish .
What ever you say ?
No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
So , what programs do you have on your laptop ?
I ' Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs .
I know you are keen on photography . It ' s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at a
It ' s wonderful , isn ' t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I took recently ?
I like to play piano , go bowling and chat with my friends . And you ?
I like to hang out with my friends , play games and go swimming .
Would you like to go out some time ?
Sure , that ' d be great . Where would you like to go ?
Anywhere with you .
Aren ' t you sweet .
That's good advice .
Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
Are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
Let me see here ... yes , there's one left .
Ok . I'll take that one then .
Alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
I like to travel light so I just have this one .
If that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?
Yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ?
You're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . Here's your boarding pass . Enjoy your flight !
They say Mr . Sun is a friendly , sensitive , caring and determined person .
What personality do you admire ?
I admire a person who is honest , flexible and easy-going .
How do you get along with others ?
I get on well with others .
Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into .
So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?
Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .
Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will .
After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ' m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice .
Do you need to be located in a particular school district ?
It doesn ' t matter , as we do not have any children .
Is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ?
In a perfect world , we would like a home with a view of the lake .
Thank you for all of the information . I will help you find the perfect house for you .
Everyone's attention , please . We are going to take off . Please fasten your belts .
Certainly . Four more stop after this . I'll call out the stops .
Thank you .
Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city .
I'll tell them .
Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor .
Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery .
Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you .
I think so . Bye !
Bye !
OK .
I feel well now .
Yes , some exercise is necessary for us .
Quite right .
All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef .
That sounds fairly simple , but how do I cook it ?
The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice .
What's next ?
Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it .
What's the next thing I need to do ?
Then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy .
That's too long . How long does it take to reach Taiwan by airmail ?
About ten days .
Then how much is that by airmail ?
Let me see . It ' s 57 dollars , 20 cents , including tax .
That's a little bit expensive .
Although it's expensive to send it by airmail , it's quicker and safer than by sea .
I guess I have to send it by airmail .
Do you want to ensure the contents , Miss ?
Yes , please .
Please fill out this form , also please write the value of the items in this space .
OK .
Good idea , especially at this price .
Come on , son , you ' re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .
Fine , then ! If that ' s the way you feel , so be it . But you ' re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ' m going to go hit up Mum for the cash .
It's four o'clock in the morning in Chicago now , but it's time to go to bed in Shanghai .
Don't think so much . Take a good sleep and you'll feel better soon .
How about some burgers ?
I already had a burger yesterday .
What are we going to do ?
We can just each get what we want to get .
That sounds like a plan .
Do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ?
I think they sell both at the cafeteria .
Does that include hotels and meals ?
Oh , yes , and admission tickets for places of interest as well .
That sounds reasonable . What about the five-day flying journey ? How much is that ?
Eight hundred and fifty yuan .
Covering all expenses ?
Yes . But there is no half fare for children . They must pay full fare .
This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ' s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
Can any mp make a law ?
Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law .
I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ' s . most mp ' s vote the way their party wants them to .
How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Voters who often change the party they vote for are Calle
Well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . But in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . How about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ?
That's fine , thank you .
Sure .
It's very smooth . I'll take it .
Cash or charge ?
Charge , please .
Not at all . You can ask the policeman over there .
Sure that sounds good . Do you have any cakes ?
We have various birthday cakes and also ice cream cakes .
I'll just take a cheesecake .
Will that be all ?
Yes .
Your total is forty three dollars and twenty cents .
I'm afraid Mr Wilson would like to speak to Mr Brown right now . He ' s got an urgent matter to discuss with Mr Brown without delay .
Ok , then would you please hold the line ? Mr Li , the line is through , Mr Brown is ready answering the call , go ahead .
Thank you for your assistance , Mr Bush .
You are welcome .
I'm a quick leamer , Mr . Jenkins .
Umm hmm . Do you have a diver's license ?
Yes , and I'm a very good driver .
Fine . We provide a company car for our consultants .
Do I have to travel a lot ?
Oh yes-five days a week . You have to visit customers all over the territory .
But how will I get to know the products ?
You'll have to attend a three-week course . If you do well , the job is yours .
How much is the salary ?
Starting salary is $ 150 a week-plus commissions , of course .
How much commission do your consultants get ?
Five percent .
Well , I'm very interested in the job .
Fine . The next course starts a week from tomorrow .
Thank you .
Good luck to you .
Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout .
This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ?
I am still waiting for their call .
Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward .
It does look a little strange , I didn't notice that before .
Oh , we've just repainted our car . It was red .
Maybe . But the car of this space has a broken rearview mirror on the left .
Yeah . It used to . We got that fixed yesterday too .
Could you wait for a minute , sir ? I'd like to have a check .
Sure , go ahead .
Sorry , sir , my mistake . This is your parking space .
That's all right . It's not your fault .
All right , ma'am . I'll check and tell them to be quiet .
If next room is still noisy , could you give me a different room , please ?
It doesn't matter . I'll try other companies .
I suggest you hunt for a job on the Internet .
On the Internet ? I've never heard of it .
It's very convenient and it has become popular recently .
Is that safe ?
Of course , if you log on some standard websites .
Thank you for your advice . I'll have a try .
I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock .
Well , then , would you send it to Japan , please ?
Yes , we'll do so .
Is there anywhere I can reach him ?
I don't believe so . He's going out of town on business . May I take a message ?
I have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , but I'm afraid I can't make it .
Would you care to make another appointment ?
Unfortunately , I'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and I may be gone for several days .
I see . I can tell Mr . Thomas that you phoned .
Thank you .
Bye-bye .
In that case , eight o'clock is fine .
Very well , and how many people will attend tonight ?
Four people .
Lastly , may I please know what name I should make the reservation under ?
Mark .
Wow , that's something new . Let's go ! What's this , honey ?
Er , is it cabbage ?
Cabbage ? Is that what they teach at school now ? OK , honey , it's spinage .
Yeah , I know , this is Popeye's favorite food .
There we go .
Mom , come here . I know this , it is carrot , am I right ?
Bingo ! It's dark outside , Let's hurry up .
Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them .
What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ?
A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment .
Don't you consider it a hard work ?
Hard but interesting , I think .
Have you any experience as a tourist guide ?
Yes , I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University .
Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English ?
Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well .
Okay , we have the same thing in aluminum .
Oh , this is nice and light . But it has an aluminum handle .
Try this one . Same aluminum pan , but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle .
Oh , yes . This is very nice . I'll take this one .
That's a good choice . How do you want to pay for it ?
Cash . Oh , I almost forgot . I need a lid , too .
I'm so sorry . A lid comes with the pan . Here it is .
7 days ! What am I supposed to do for money until then ?
If you bring some ID with you , it's possible for you to make a withdrawal over the counter if you need to . But unfortunately , without your new card you cannot use the ATM , so all withdrawals must be made within working hours .
Yes , it's true . It has been delayed .
Could you please tell me why ?
Yes , of course . The delay is due to heavy rain .
How long will the delay be ? Do you have any further information about it ?
I am sorry , we don't know the extent of the delay at present . But according to the latest weather forecast , there will be a change in weather soon .
We have to wait . Well , is it possible for the rain to stop before noon ?
It's hard to say . Weather is so changeable in the summer . Please listen to the latest announcement about your flight .
Yes , I will . Thanks a lot . Bye !
Bye
I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails .
So you have to open all the envelopes .
Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly .
Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas .
I'll put the song at the front of the list .
when I was little , we had a few domestic dogs at home .
they always say that dogs are a man's best friends . do you think that's true ?
definitely . rich or poor , dogs always love their masters .
how about cats ? Have you ever had one for a pet ?
i had one a few months ago , but she ended up running away .
how did that happen ?
she left through a window that was open one night and never returned .
you must have been devastated !
i was pretty sad . i still hope that she'll return some day !
I hope she does . Do you think you'll ever get another pet ?
I think I will . It's difficult to feel longly when you have a pet around .
i hope your cat finds its way back home .
i do , too .
Well sir , yes . How about this stew ? We can serve you at once .
I ' ll take this stew then .
Any other benefits ?
Yes , we have an excellent retirement plan and medical insurance as well .
Great . Thanks so much for your time .
We ' ll contact you soon , Ted . Thanks for coming in .
You'd better have a good rest for a week . Be sure to have regular meals . Stay away from alcohol . Give up smoking at least a little while .
Should I take some medicine ?
Yes . I'm going to give you some . Take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . For that one , two tablets . And remember to come to the out patient department for a consultation in two weeks , please .
It's very kind of you .
You're welcome . We wish you a speedy recovery . Goodbye .
I ' d like to get a jar of strawberry jam and a bottle of tomato ketchup . Do we need any meat ?
I think we should get half a kilo of minced beef and a few pork chops .
Ok . Let ' s not forget fruit and vegetables . We need a bunch of bananas , a kilo of tomatoes and a bag of potatoes .
We should also get a tube of toothpaste and a bar of soap . Let ' s get a tub of ice cream too . We can treat ourselves .
Ok . We should get a few tins of tuna . Anything else ?
I ' d like a few cans of coke . We also need a dozen eggs and half a dozen sausages .
let ' s get a chunk of cheese too . Is that everything .
I think so . I ' Ve got the shopping list , so let ' s go .
No . We took a wrong turn somewhere . And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions . But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost .
You could have called .
I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were .
You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ?
Guess where we ended up .
I don't know . Where ?
When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield .
Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ?
I don't know . The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
I know it is . I don't know how it happened .
Hmm , maybe I do .
What ?
Maybe I have an idea how it happened .
How ?
You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road .
Oh , that's what you think , huh ?
I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % .
I ' m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ?
We've already cut down our price to cost level .
Is that all ?
Yes , this is the best we can do .
I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered .
and how about Internet access ?
there's free Internet access in the lobby .
is it available in the rooms ?
Unfortunately not .
that's OK . Is breakfast included ?
yes , breakfast is included and parking is available .
fantastic . Thank you very much .
you're welcome . And we have 24 hour reception . Please don't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions .
American .
What's your relationship with the victim ?
I don't know him .
Why did you attack the victim ?
Because he beat me first when I tried to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away .
How many times did you stab the victim ?
I stabbed his belly three times .
Did you know hat your actions might cause serous injuries or death ?
I knew , but I couldn't control myself .
Was it your intention to kill the victim ?
No . I didn't kill him on purpose , madam . It's him who caused the incident . I need to see my attorney .
OK . Give me his number and we'll contact him .
What are all the symptoms ?
Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water .
That doesn't sound good .
No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ?
Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family .
Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol .
I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body .
That's pretty bad .
But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah .
Yes , my name is Brian and my phone number is 5294870 .
Thank you .
I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ' t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures .
I ' m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP !
You will need to fill out a Continued Claim Form every two weeks .
What information will I need to provide on that form ?
They will need to know where you worked and how much money you made .
Are there any other questions on the form ?
Basically , they want to know that you were available for work and not sick .
How would you like the corn ?
I don't understand what you mean .
Do you want it boiled , grilled , or microwaved ?
Why don't you grill it ?
That's how you want it ?
Yeah , that sounds delicious .
Okay , I'll grill some corn then .
I agree . They're very lovely , especially " Huan Huan " .
is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ?
the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive .
oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ?
I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now .
any other ideas ?
there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts .
it all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have .
Thank you for your honesty . I assure you there will be no cockroaches next time .
And that'll be 10:15 p . m . Beijing time .
Good , as long as you understand that .
And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ?
Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month .
That sounds ideal .
Hey , don't be so pathetic . It's a maximal sports show . What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ?
They are all very experienced and great skiers . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow in here ?
Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ?
Hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist .
Sorry . Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .
Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
It's possible . But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
It's a good thing . OK , let's go skiing .
Here we go .
Is it their home , office or cell phone numbers ?
Unless it ' s marked differently , it ' s their home numbers .
Alright . What if I can ' t get a hold of them by phone ?
Then , you should e-mail them with the information .
Where can I find their e-mail addresses ?
They should have then listed on their resumes .
And if there aren ' t any e-mail addresses ?
Then send them a SMS on their cell phone .
Ok . That sounds easy enough . Have you called any of them yet ?
Yes . I called the first three people on the list , but they didn ' t pick up .
Did you leave a voice message ?
I left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list .
I see . What did you tell her ?
I told her that she should call me back at my office number .
Ok , so , maybe I should call her again .
Yes , that sounds like a good idea . She might not get the other message in time .
One more question . It looks like some of these numbers are long-distance . Do you have a calling card that I can use to get through to them ?
Sure . You can use this one . The pin number is written on the back of the card .
Alright . Thanks a lot . Don ' t worry . I ' ll take care of it .
Great work . I ' m off for the weekend ! See you on Monday .
See you .
About seven thirty . By the way , could you also bring me tomorrow's papers ?
Of course , sir .
Thank you .
No problem .
Sure . It's a most popular dish .
I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together .
We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ?
What kind do you have ?
We have French and Thousand Island .
Make it Thousand Island .
Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake .
What do you recommend we do ?
I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible .
I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now .
I can help you figure it out .
What do I have to do ?
Slide your card into the machine .
Then what ?
You need to type your PIN in .
What do I have to do next ?
Click on whichever option you want , and you ' re done .
What are you best at ?
I am good at organizing systems that have been having problems .
What is your biggest challenge in terms of skills ?
I don ' t like to sit around and so like to always find things to do to keep myself busy .
That is good to hear !
Well , uh ... I ' m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ?
Do you mind if I sit down ?
Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ?
I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ?
Yes . But why should you want to do that ?
Do you mind if I speak frankly ?
Not at all . Go ahead .
Well . You see , I don ' t like the office . I don ' t like the staff . And I ' m afraid of you . And I don ' t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ?
Yes . I ' d be delighted if you did .
Of course ! Everything at Helen ' s is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn ' t you shop around ?
I don ' t know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive .
How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ?
Yeah , are they easy to look after ?
Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything .
Good . Now just complete this form .
Well , don't bother . I'll take it with me . Will that be all right ?
Thank you , sir . Here is your tag . This cloakroom is open till 11:00 p . m . , could you pick it up by then ?
Sure . thank you .
No , nothing . It's thoughtful of you to call me again .
Thank you . Please call me at any time if you have any questions .
Ok , I will . Do you have any question ?
No , thank you . Goodbye .
Goodbye .
Honey , just turn down the stove .
That's all right . I'm almost finished . Do you need my help ?
Yes , could you please go over this for me ? and see if there is any mistake in it ?
Oh . all right I'll read it soon .
Excuse me for taking your time .
It's nothing Navy .
Have you decided ?
Yes . I want to get a better job .
Could you tell me why you want to quit ?
I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?
I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .
OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
Thank you so much for your advice .
And every best wish for your new job .
Thank you .
I am very impressed .
I feel that history is about to be made , and I want to be a part of it .
That is very nice of you .
Will you be voting ?
Yes , I am going to vote .
Make sure you make it to your polling place early on Election Day .
Thank you and good luck .
Just fill it up with Regular , Unleaded , please .
Do you want me to check the tires and the fluids ?
Yes , I would . Thanks a lot .
Are you free today at around 6 p . m . ?
Yes , I will be able to make it then .
Well , I'll see you at 6 p . m . Do you know how to get there ?
I used to live in that area .
I'll give you an application form when I see you .
That sounds good . Do I need to bring anything ?
No . Just bring yourself .
It's the most important thing to me .
If you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ?
That obviously depends on how things go - - whether I'm suited to the firm and the firm to me .
Tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them .
I want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . In order to achieve this goal , I just want to work step by step .
What is your long-range objective ?
I haven't thought it over at all .
What do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ?
I think the most important thing is the interest in the job .
Thirty minutes in gym at lunch time .
Oh no .
Use the stairs , never the elevator .
Oh , dear .
And three times a week , you can either swim , play racketball , or hand ball .
Oh no .
OK , you can stop now . It ' s time for the dance class .
Dance class ! I don't know how .
You will .
Oh ...
No , it won't .
So when will it be here then ?
Never .
Never ?
That's right . The number forty-four doesn't stop here any more . Its stop is round the corner .
100 frances .
Mmm , it is reasonable . Look at this set of table wear , it is so beautiful !
We have a piece of table clothing to go with it . It is a brocade one with pretty stars .
This silver vase is a good ornament for the living room .
You are right .
I will take the tapestry , the set of table wear and the vase .
OK . Do you like these candles ? They are on sale now .
All right . I will take one .
Mmmm ... and exactly how many times did you enter it , please ?
Maybe three times . As I said , I always forget it .
Ah ! Don't worry ; it's just a security measure . If someone uses a card and cannot get the right PIN after three attempts , the bank keeps the card in case it's stolen . Just contact the bank and we'll get it back to you .
Oh , I see . So if I call my branch they can sort everything out for me ?
Yes , they'll be happy to help . Believe me , it happens to many people .
I'd better try harder to memorise my PIN in future . Thanks .
I have never seen those before , but since you're so excited it should be good .
I'm sure you'll love it .
Okay , I will go and get some popcorn first .
They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory .
The pass is free .
I don't have to pay for anything ?
You'll only have to pay for the monthly sticker .
How much is the monthly sticker ?
It's $ 24 for each month .
I'll take the student bus pass .
Okay , I'll get you one .
OK . Just keep in mind it has to be somebody who can get along with Elvin .
Don't sweat it . I know just the guy .
Oh , yeah ?
Yeah , where is yours ?
I don ' t know .
How is it you don ' t know ?
The location of my polling place never came in the mail .
You can always just check online .
Let me go do that .
No , sir . The tax is included .
I don't have any .
I don't know how I'm going to get home .
Get a transfer from the bus driver .
How much is a transfer ?
It doesn't cost anything .
That's great ! Thanks for your help .
You know what ? Don't mention it .
I'm going to try to find a place near the office .
Where are you living now ?
Out in the suburbs . It's a long trip to work every day .
How are you going to find an apartment ?
I'm going to buy a newspaper and check the classified ads .
Apartments in the city are expensive .
I know , but I'm going to enroll in a night school to take a course in business management .
Shall I come in and collect it ?
Or we can send it to you . But if you would like to use it at the ATM , you'll need to wait for your PIN number .
Mmmm ... if I come in and collect it this afternoon , is there any way I could use it today ? Petty cash is getting low , so I need to draw some money .
As long as you bring your ID , etc , we can serve you over the counter . But you won't be able to use the ATM until your new PIN number arrives .
I see . Yes , that's fine . I'll be there at around 2:30 pm . See you later , and thanks .
But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ' s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries .
I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ' s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ' t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ' t changed much over the years .
There ' s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ' s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price .
Well , we ' ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ' ll have to try , I suppose .
Like what ?
Don't be nosey .
I'm not . I just want to know .
Well , it's really none of your business .
That's harsh .
I'm sorry , but I have to go .
Fine .
When do you have lunch ?
From one to two .
What do you normally eat ?
We usually go to the cafeteria .
Oh , it ' s time to have lunch now .
let ' s go together .
Perhaps you should get checked out at the Student Health Center before you go home .
I have some medicine at home that I could take .
Are you going to be OK to drive home , or would you like someone to go with you ?
Thank you , but my friend is in the library , and he can give me a ride home .
We hope that you are feeling better soon . E-mail me if you have any questions .
I really hope it doesn't get cold .
That would ruin things , I want to go so badly .
The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know .
That is true . The weather is constantly changing .
It would be nice if the weather would never change .
That would be great , then we could plan things sooner .
True . Predictable weather would make life easier .
I ' m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong .
For example ?
Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics .
Yes . Such people don ' t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs .
I'll go back to the office and get it sorted and pop back later . Thanks , bye for now .
Sir , we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel .
You dare to doubt me ?
I'm sorry , sir . Let me transfer you to my supervisor .
What park do you want to go to ?
Daniel wants to go to the aquarium . While Mom wants to visit the Summer Palace .
Haven't we been these places already ?
Yeah . I don't agree with them , but I don't have a better choice .
What about the Olympic park ?
Right , ah . It is so close to our home . How come we've never thought of that ?
The Olympic Park has a small forest . It is fit for picnic .
Very well , Go ahead .
That would be our Savers Plus account . You must pay 10 000 yuan into your deposit account . In this way you can get 5 % dividend at the end of the year .
All right . I'II open this one .
Just fill out these forms , and I ' ll be with you in one second .
Thanks .
One more from Carla .
A playpen and crib ! Thanks Carla ! This is just what I needed !
OK , that ' s all of them . No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ?
Umm . I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital !
Cool !
Grabbing , pushing and shoving ...
You have to maintain a balance of $ 10,000 in the account or the rate drops to 3 % .
All right . I ' ll open one of those .
Just fill out these forms , and I ' ll be with you in one second .
Thanks .
I'm sorry . We don't have this color in your size . We have some green ones in your size . Would you please have a look at this green one ?
OK . How much does it cost ?
It's 486 yuan .
Yes , of course .
Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ?
Ok . Does he know your number ?
I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 .
13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on .
Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted .
Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing . Everyone has to have something . For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ?
No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker .
Well , what would you like to talk to me about ?
I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .
I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it .
It is about the staff meetings . You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday .
Yes .
Well , I have been thinking about it . And I believe we could do things more efficiently here .
What do you suggest ?
The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week . We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation .
You mean because people have to go across town to get here .
Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road .
That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them .
I think they are important too . That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them .
I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that .
Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more .
Well .
I also think the meetings should be more focused . And I would be willing to take responsibility for that .
You mean you want to run the meetings ?
No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting . This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .
Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks .
I really think it would work . The meetings could be longer , and better organized .
I am not against the idea , Arnold . It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do . Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works .
Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it .
I will call the managers . Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this " new style . "
They really smell fragrant . How much is a real sandalwood fan ?
The small ones are one hundred yuan for each . And the big ones are two hundred and thirty yuan .
I'll take two small ones and a big one .
What else are you interested in ?
I'm afraid not .
OK . Here you are .
Is that all ?
Yes . How much is it to send these things to Shanghai by regular delivery ?
It depends on the weight of these things . Generally speaking , we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram .
I see . Can you weigh them for me , please ?
Please go over there to weigh them .
OK . See you later .
To be honest , I really wasn't .
What speed were you going ?
I was under the speed limit . I was going 35 , when the speed limit was 40 .
I'm just going to let you go , since the arresting officer isn't here .
What about my ticket ? Do I still need to pay ?
Don't worry about it .
I'm so glad for your help .
Sure , I'll try my best . Here we are .
How much should I pay you ?
The reading on the meter is 15 yuan .
Here's 20 yuan , keep the change .
Thank you very much .
I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children .
I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking .
all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty .
perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow .
I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them .
that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad .
you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking .
Well , let me check again under a different heading .
Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files .
Maybe that's why I couldn't find it . All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V ' .
Not at all .
No , not all summer . Just for six weeks .
I'm afraid I can only rent it for two months .
My holiday is only six weeks , but I think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks . Is the house in good condition ?
Yes , it is . It was just painted and it has all the modern conveniences .
