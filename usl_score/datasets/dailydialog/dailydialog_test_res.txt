I'm sorry to have bothered you .
No problem .
I've a driver mate in my car !
So you have all the news on broadcast ?
Yes , it's so helpful .
Sure , anything you say .
Actually , it ' s a little bit silly .
Don ' t worry about it , just ask .
What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes ?
You need to know the type of shoes you want .

I ran a red light ?
Yes , you did .
I apologize , but I didn't realize that I did .
Weren't you taught that yellow means slow down , not speed up ?
I did learn that .
So , then why did you speed up ?
I don't know what to tell you .
I'm going to have to write you a ticket .
I understand .
Here you go . Don't do that again .
External factors . I think the main external factors are political , economic , social and technological factors .

I tend to stick to fruits , vegetables , and chicken .
Those are the only things you eat ?
That's basically what I eat .
Why aren't you eating anything else ?
Well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy .
And the chicken ?
It's really healthy to eat when you bake it .
I guess that does sound a lot healthier .
Yes , I'd like to check out now . My name's Adams , room 312 . Here's the key .

Ah , well then I ' d recommend a nice entry-level digital SLR .
Yeah ? Can I take a look at the Sirs you carry ?
Sure thing , follow me . This here is the .
The Canon Eos . Yeah it ' s ok , but I ' m looking for something that performs better in low light , has a better display panel , and longer battery life .
Oh , ah , um the Nikon D60 is a nice option .
Yeah , but what kit lens does this camera come with ? I don ' t want some bulky telephoto lens .
Oh , well this one has the , uh .
Looks to me like an 18-55 mm lens . pretty standard , that will do . Not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything !

Accessories ? Do you carry polarizing filters ?
Polarizing filter um we should ! I ' m sorry , ma ' am . It looks like we ' re sold out .

No problem , ma ' am .
Tired and stressed . This wedding is giving me a headache .
Just relax . With me as your maid of honor , everything will be fine !
I'm worried that everything will be chaotic !
Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests .
You're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ...
I will . Don't worry !
Something important ?
Yes . I have just booked two tickets .
Tickets ? What tickets ?
Two air tickets .
Air tickets ?
Yes . We will fly to Paris the day after tomorrow .
We ? The day after tomorrow ? What are you talking about ?
Today is June 18 , isn ' t it ?
Yes . So ?
Think about it !
Then it is June 20 the day after tomorrow .
Yes . Think about it carefully .
Oh , come on . Tell me please . Why did you book tickets to Paris ?
Oh , honey ! Don ' t you remember this important day to us ?
Sorry .
It is our 10th wedding anniversary this June 20 .
Our 10th wedding anniversary ?
Of course . You completely forgot it .
Darling . I think you have made a mistake .
I have made a mistake ?
Yes . We married on July 20 ten years ago .
July 20 ? But I think it should be June 20 .
Yes . We had planned to marry on June 20 , but something happened , so we had to put off our wedding day .
Yes . I remember now . We put it off . I did make a mistake . But how shall we deal with the tickets ?
Since you have booked . Then let ' s celebrate our wedding anniversary before hand .
Sure . I usually have my lunch here . The food is tasty and they offer a big variety .
Let's line up . The steak is very inviting . I'll have it .
I'll have ham and egg with French fries . What dessert do you want ?
Banana pie .
Where shall we sit ?
How about there ?
I need some remedies for an upset stomach .
Are you also suffering from pain and fever ?
Yes , and I also have the runs
I'll give you some tablets that should make you feel better . One moment , please . Here you are . Take these tablets three times a day swallow them with water .
When should I take them ?
Take on after each meal .
How long should I continue taking them ?
Take them for two days . If your symptoms persist for more than two days , you should see a doctor Also , be sure to drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration .
Thank you for your advice .
Where have you been ? I've been trying to get in touch with you for two days .
I went to Salt Lake City on business . What's up ?
I got fired .
How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ?
It's a long story . In a word , I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up .
What are you going to do now ?
I am trying to find a job asap . Lily doesn't know yet . I didn't tell her . I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought I went to work as usual .
That's not the way to solve the problem . Did you look in the classified advertisements column ?
Yes , I did . But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in .
Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand .
I just don't know how to bring it up . Well , all right . She has the right to know anyways .
Here are some . They ' re on special sale these days .
That's more reasonable . I'll take this one .
How many credits for each course ?
Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department .
Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will .
No , you'll have to get off at the bank , and take a No . 50 .
Thank you . How much is the fare to that stop ?
One dollar .
How many stops are there ?
Two stops after this one .
Could you please tell me when we get there ?
Sure .
By the way , do I need a transfer again after No . 50 ?
No , a No . 50 will take you right there .
Thank you .
It ' s so cool !
That's too bad .
$ 60 .
I am sure you can do better than that .
Sorry , sir . It's the sale price .
Well , what about $ 70 with a scarf ?
It's my rock bottom price . Take it or leave it .
We'd better not move him . I'll get the first-aider .
Thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side .
This is our rock-bottom price , and we can't make any further reduction .
If so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks .
Then what ' s your counter-offer ?
This is our counter-offer .
We are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great .
So are we . Our counter-offer is in line with the world market .
How about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ?
Agreed .
Hello , I need a new suit . I have an important interview next week , so I really need to look sharp .
No problem ! We have a broad selection of suits , all tailored made so that it will fit perfectly .
Great ! I want a three piece suit , preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool .
Very well sir . Would you like to have some shirts made also ?
Sure . I ' ll also take some silver cuff link and a pair of silk ties .
Very good . Now , if you will accompany me , we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts .
We would like to start you off at 1,500 yuan a month , not including bonus and overtime pay . We don ' t give bonus every month , but we offer a semi-annual bonus . And you will receive two weeks paid vacation a year , as well . Does it suit you ?
Yes , thank you . May I ask for an apartment ?
No problem . We'll supply you with an apartment of two bedrooms and a living room .
Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan .
Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive .
Really ? Even for such an excellent one ?
Thank you . So pleasant to meet you here !
I heard that you are interested in our silk skirts and new style of coats .
Yes , I've brought a list of your recent products with me . We'd like to import some of your latest clothes for the second half of this year . We're ready to place an order with you .
Great ! B , most of the items listed are available this year . I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts , so as to enable our timely delivery .
That sounds good . But I have a proposal now .
What's the proposal ?
Both of our two parties were involved in the discussion previously . Shall we also allow some of our clients to join us ?
Good idea ! In this way , our clients ' needs will be met and disagreements between the two parties avoided .
Sounds like we have the same idea .
Yes , I am .
Shall we have dinner together ?
Do you have a special restaurant in mind ?
Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food .
OK . I'll be happy to join you .
Yes , I'm now working in a company .
So you're quite happy with your new job ?
Right . I enjoy what I'm doing .
That is awesome . Congratulation ! I know you can make it .
Thanks . Let ' s go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ?
Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . See 5PM , ok ?
No problem . See you !
See you !
I went shopping .
Did you buy anything ?
Yes , I bought a few things .
What did you buy ?
I bought this coat . Do you like it ?
Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ?
At the mall on 5th street .
Was it expensive ?
No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars .
That's cheap .
I know . It was a really good deal .
I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately .
Oh , I'm fine .
So , are you going to go to class tonight ?
Maybe ... but I don't think so .
Really ? What's the matter ?
I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad .
Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner .
Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already .
Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks .
I love history , but I ' Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened .
I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks !
Some people say that history repeats itself .
What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ?
The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same .
I see . I think I ' d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .
How much would you like to borrow ?
A thousand dollars .
Let me check with a credit manager . A record show your credit reading is quite high . I don't think you have any problems .
What ' s the current interest rate ?
Our monthly interest is 1 . 5 % of the outstanding balance . Would you please fill out the application the form ?
What is it ? What happened ?
I think someone is stalking me .
No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?
I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring . He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .
What did you do ?
I didn't do anything . Finally , he left . But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .
Did he leave when you left ?
Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .
What did you do ?
I do . Why , do you want me to change the channel ?
Yes , please . I can't stand watching the channel any more .
I think they have pretty good programmes . But I'll change it if you really want .
Put it on Channel 5 , OK ?
Oh , I hate Channel 5 . I'd rather just listen to the radio .
Don't make such a fuss . I'm sure you will like today's programme .
What's on today ?
A basketball match between Chinese team and American team .
Really ? I'm interested in it .
It might begin now .
Cloudy in the morning , overcast in the afternoon .
Any rain ?
No , but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow .
I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days .
I'm from Canada , originally .
From Canada ? Where were you born ?
Montreal .
When did you come to Los Angeles ?
We moved here when I was fourteen .
Did you go to school here ?
Well , I went to high school here , but I went to college in Texas .
Did you get a job right after graduation ?
No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France .
When was that ?
Let's see ... That was about six years ago .
I bet that was interesting . What did you do there ?
I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me . How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ?
Yes , hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit .
That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate .
And I can purchase that here ?
Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us , the Insurance Premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle .
It's not even noon yet .
That means it will get hotter .
I am dying from the heat .
Turn on the air conditioner .
It doesn't work .
What happened ?
I don't know .
Did you call the repairman ?
Of course .
When is he coming ?
He's busy . He said next week .
They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final .
No way , if it still has 21 .
Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things .
What are they ?
They are keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
And what is the most important point ?
You should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .
Yes , please . I ' m Mr . Peter , the Director of Personnel . What can I do for you ?
Nice to meet you , Mr . Peter . I ' m Wang Sian . I ' Ve come for an interview as requested .
Oh , yes . How do you do , Miss Wang ? Sit down , please .
Thank you .
What was your major in school ?
I majored in Public Relations .
Have you done any work in this field ?
Yes , after my graduation , I worked in a trade company in Macao for one year .
What section did you work in ?
The export Business Section .
So you must be very familiar with export procedures .
Yes , very much .
That's good .
Sorry , I thought you knew .
But you should tell me you were in love with her .
Didn't I ?
You know you didn't .
Well , I am telling you now .
Yes , but you might have told me before .
I didn't think you would be interested .
You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?
Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .
Oh , you men ! You are all the same .
Sure , what is the problem ?
I got poison oak while hiking , and I need something to help me with the itching .
I can suggest a product called Techne that comes in a lotion or cream .
Which do you prefer ?
Hikers tell me that the cream is best because it stays on longer .
Is there anything else I can do to help with the itching ?
You can take an antihistamine .
Thank you so much for all of the information .
You are welcome . Please feel free to ask me a question any time you need help .
I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year .
oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ?
we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec
wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait !
tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ?
perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank .
no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .
we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning .
great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain .
no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week .
Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us .
I'm afraid he's away from his desk at the moment .
Do you know when he will be back ?
He's away on a business trip . He won't be back until some time next week .
Is there some way I can get into contact with him ?
The best way to reach him is by cell phone . I'll give you his number .
Thanks . And could I have his e-mail , just in case I can't get him by phone ?
Sure . His cell phone is 09112223 33 . And his e-mail is lower case t , smith--that's one word , at , c , c , w , dot , com , dot , t , w .
Thank you so much . Does he read his e-mails daily ?
Yes . He usually replies immediately .
Great . Thanks again . You've been very helpful .
My pleasure . I hope you get a hold of him .
Sorry . I'll clean it up .
Yeah , some places are very short of water .
Because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse .
You see , This time I traveled to the West . When I looked out of the windows of the rain , all the lands that I could see are as dry as a bone .
It is serious .
Yeah , I ' m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains .
Oh , do you go hiking often ?
I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature .
It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ?
Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ?
Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike .
Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city .
Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest .
Well , bring him along too . We ' ll have a great time this weekend .
Thanks , I ' ll ask him .
It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks .
You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks .
That give us a good lesson .
Marry Lin please .
Sure , just a moment . ... I'm sorry no one answer the phone .
All right , could I leave a message ?
Certainly !
Please ask her to call John .
I'm quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like to leave things half-done .
Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
I'm quite outgoing i think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself I think . A friend in need is a friend in deed . The more really close friends I have , the better .
What kind of people do you like to work with ?
People who are honest , dedicated to their work and having integrity .
Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ?
It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day .
You forgot all of about it , didn't you ?
I'm pretty tired these days .
Why ? You're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands ?
I have so much house work to do . I have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends .
How about your husband . Does he help much ?
Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ?
That sucks .
If he wasn't so lazy , I think I wouldn't have any complaints . He mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ?
That's crossing the line .
Oh well . I'll have to live with it . What else can I do ?
If you go onto our website and put in your password , you can access your test results .
Are you saying that there weren ' t any problems ?
I will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem .
Will I be able to read the results on the website and understand them ?
Yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about .
How will I know what the numbers mean ?
You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range .
How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ?
We put all of your test results up in the same place . Just check the dates for what you need .
Do you have any special brand in your mind ?
No , I never wear suit in my everyday life . I just want one to take part in my sister ' s wedding ceremony .
I see . Have a look at this one . It ' s very cheap because it ' s not very durable .
but it looks good . Let me try it on .
Ok , the mirror is over there .
Well , people from Asia to Europe all enjoy tea .
Right . And China is the homeland of tea .
Yes , Chinese people love drinking tea so much . Some even claim they can't live without tea .
Do you know there are several catagories of Chinese tea ?
Yes , I believe there are green teas , black teas and scented teas . Any Others ?
Well , have you ever heard of Oulong tea and compressed tea ?
Oh , yeah . Oulong tea is good for one's health . isn't it ?
You surely know a lot about Chinese tea .
Sure , I like drinking tea at teahouses .
Oh , so do I .
Why don't we go for one now ?
Great . We can chat while enjoying a cup there .
Let's go !
I graduated from Peking University .
What was your major at university ?
I studied economics , I am especially interested in the economic development of China .
What course did you like best ?
I like Business Management , and i think it's very useful for the present work .
What do you think is the relationship between the subjects you've taken and the job you are seeking ?
I've taken courses on office administration , reports and correspondence writing . I think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager , because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
Sorry . I was too worried .
I firmly believe that you love your brother very much .
Absolutely . By the way , do you sell any traditional Chinese medicine ?
Yes , we have some Chinese medicine for common cold .
I heard Chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure .
It depends . It's true that you can take some for prevention .
I've been trying to get through to the booking office for the last ten minutes . But the line has been engaged all the time . Why is it taking so long ?
I'm sorry to hear that . I'm afraid it is often the case during the peak hours . Shall I ask them to call you when the line is free ?
OK . Please do so if it is not troublesome .
No trouble at all . May I know your name and room number ?
I'm Du Juan , in Room 312 .
I see . Wait in the room , please .
Thank you for your kindness .
Yes , we are just looking for one . What's the charge per day ?
It's $ 20 . If you are staying for more than 3 days in the city , the charge is $ 16 per day .
That's reasonable .
I'll see what I have . What do you need it for ?
I want to get cigarettes .
You can use quarters , dimes and nickels .
Thanks , Jim . I didn ' t think guys paid attention to stuff like that .
No , we just don ' t usually admit it !
Well , thanks for the compliment anyway !
Really ?
But I think Henry is a backroom boy . He always helps her with her study .
You're right .
That's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library !
I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas .
That is right up my alley . You say party and I'm there .
Perfect . It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people .
Will it be an all day event ?
Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library .
That was quick thinking .
That's terrible !
Not great . It's a kind of boring .
Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great .
Yes , me too . But I'm disappointed .
I ' m fine . I ' Ve been out of town . I just got back .
Where were you ?
I was in New York for a wedding .
Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice .
And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water .
Exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together .
There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming .
That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games .
Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you .
My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you .
OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool .
Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that .
I have to start eating better too .
What kind of food do you usually eat ?
I try my best to eat only fruits , vegetables , and chicken .
Is that really all that you eat ?
That's basically it .
How do you stick to only those foods ?
Actually , fruits and veggies are really good for you .
Yeah , I know , but what about the chicken ?
I mainly eat baked chicken , because there's not a lot of fat .
That does sound pretty good .
I know it does , and that's because it is .
Well , we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at 2:00 .
I tell you what , 2:00 is not available for me , but you can get started and I'll come by at around 3:00
That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ?
Perhaps one year , I'm not sure .
Sure . What do you need ?
I'm having some trouble . How do you use this printer ?
Well , first you have to turn this switch on .
Silly me .
Now press this button .
Oh , and it's out of paper . Do you have any more ?
Just a second . I'll go get some .
I usually have cereal for breakfast .
But isn't it served with cold milk ?
Yeah . Cold milk wakes me up .
Chinese people don't like to eat cold food .
Is that right ?
But I'm open to new things . I'll have a bowl of cereal , too .
With cold milk ?
With cold milk !
We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike .
I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour . There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out .
Yes , I almost slid too . Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ?
Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped . Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .
Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop .
There . Stop !
We have a great variety of Chinese antiques . Besides , we have landscape painting , figure painting and flower-and-bird painting .
I'd like a flower-and-bird painting .
How about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? It was painted by a famous Chinese painter in King Dynasty .
Oh , they look just like live cranes .
And what is more , in traditional Chinese thinking , cranes and pine trees symbolize longevity .
I'll accompany my wife to the hospital .
What's wrong with her .
She is expecting .
Congratulations to you .
Thank you .
Enough is enough . I know .
It's us .
What do you mean by " us " ?
Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married . Remember ?
What do you mean ? We ' re talking now , aren't we ?
Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together .
Yes . I remember . But we never used to argue . You used to think I was wonderful . Where are you going ?
Back to live with my parents . That's something else I used to do before we were married . Remember ?
Yes , I would like to reserve a room for next Monday .
Wait a moment , please . Let me check it .
By the way , I want a large room .
Right now we have a suite for 4 people , do you want to book it ?
Yes , that's what I am looking for . I will take the room for 2 days .
Hi , Robert . This is Janet Reese calling from American Advertising . We placed an order with you about a week ago .
Yes , Ms . Reese . I remember , you spoke with me . Is there a problem ?
Well , it still hasn ' t gotten here , and my boss is pretty angry about it .
Yes , it is .
It looks like it may rain soon .
Yes , and I hope that it does .
Why is that ?
I really love how rain clears the air .
Me too . It always smells so fresh after it rains .
Yes , but I love the night air after it rains .
Really ? Why is that ?
Because you can see the stars perfectly .
I really hope it rains today .
Yeah , me too .
How can you be so sure ?
He knows a lot about law and he ' s eloquent , too .
Do you have the ' The man and the Sea ' by Ernest Hemingway ?
Yes , we have one copy left .
Can you hold it for me ?
Yes , I want to send a registered airmail letter to France .
Ok , it comes four dollars twenty cents .
Here is five dollars .
Here is your change . Please wait for your receipt of the registered mail .
I also want to pack up my package . This is the notes .
Let me see . En .. just a minute . Here it is . I need your signature on this note .
Oh , one more thing , where can I mail this letter ?
Drop it in the mail box mark out of town . at that corner .
Thank you very much .
You ' re welcome .
you can buy the bubble wrap here , but you ' ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage .
that ' s a really long line . How long do you think it ' ll take to get through all those people ?
it takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ' ll probably be about an hour ' s wait .
can I buy stamps here ?
sure . How many would you like ?
I need 30 for my Christmas cards .
are you sending them abroad ?
twenty of them are going abroad to China and America .
do you have any going anywhere in the EU ? If you do , those are less expensive .
no .
ok , here you go . That will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence .
and the bubble wrap ?
that ' s another quid .
thanks a lot . You ' Ve been very helpful .
Let me check . Oh , oh ! It ' s at 3:25 .
Wow , that's cutting it close ! That means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! What gate is it at ?
It ' s at ... gate 14 .
Oh , great ! That ' s at the other end of the terminal !
OK , so here ' s the plan ; When we land , run to gate 14 !
I ' m be right behind ya !
Yes . Do you like it ?
It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent .
Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it .
Is classical music your favorite ?
Yes . What about you ?
I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .
Pop music doesn't have any depth for me .
Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it .
Did you always like pop music .
I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music .
I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life .
oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play .
Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy .
Who ?
John Smith , the escaped criminal .
That bad egg , who took the low road since he was a boy .
I think I must report to the cops .
Ok .
Yes , I am .
I'm pleased to meet you , Mrs . Green . My name is Myra . I work in Beijing Institute of Technology . I came here to meet you .
How do you do ?
How do you do ?
It's kind of you to meet me at the airport .
Welcome to Beijing . Is this your first time in China ?
No , I have visited China several times , but it's my first visit to Beijing and I think it's a great honor to be invited to your beautiful city .
It's our pleasure to have you here . I hope you will have a pleasant stay here .
Thank you . I'm sure I will have a wonderful time here .
I ' m afraid I ' m a poor talker . I ' m not comfortable talking with the people whom I have just met for the first time . That is not very good for business , so I have been studying public speaking .
Are you more of a leader or a follower ?
I don ' t try to lead people . I ' d rather cooperate with everybody , and get the job done by working together .
Do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English ?
Yes , in most circumstances .
Are you available for travel ?
Yes , I like travelling . I am young , and unmarried . It ' s no problem for me to travel frequently .
Hello , George .
Have you just been to the cinema ?
Yes , I have .
What ' s on ?
Paris in the Spring .
Oh , I ' Ve already seen it . I saw it on television last year . It ' s an old film , but it ' s very good .
Paris is a beautiful city . I have never been there . Have you ever been there , Ken ?
Yes , I have . I was there in April .
Paris in the spring , eh ?
It was spring , but the weather was awful . It rained all the time .
Just like dear old London !
I ' m going to visit my brother . he ' s just had a baby . He lives in Minneapolis .
And how long do you you plan to remain in the United States ?
I ' ll be here for approximately three weeks . See , here ' s my return ticket for the twenty-sixth of March .
And , who is sponsoring your trip ?
My brother , here , this is an invitation letter from him . I will stay with him and his family in their home .
Alright , tell me about the ties you have to your home country .
Well , I own a house . actually , I ' m leaving my dog there with my neighbors . I have a car at home , and oh , my job ! I ' m employed by Tornal as an engineer . Actually , I only have three weeks ' vacation , so I have to go back to work at the end of March .
And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ?
Well , I do have assets in my country . like I said , I own a house , and see , here ' s a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance .
I ' m sorry , sir , we cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time , instead , you are granted a resident visa ! Congratulations , you are the millionth person to apply for a visa ! You win ! Congratulations !
Sure ! What do you feel like having ?
I really feel like having a big juicy steak !
Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ?
I didn't know you were a vegetarian !
I'm not , I am a vegan .
A what ?
A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood .
Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough !
It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult .
I think my English is fairly good . As you can see from my CV , I graduated from university with a B . A . degree in English . I studied the English language and English literature systematically .
How are your typing and shorthand skills ?
I can type 80 words a minute , basically no mistake , and can take dictation in English at 120 words per minute .
But that was the first thing that came into my mind when I heard the shout earthquake !
Why not use staircases ? The terror was not so violent at that time .
That would be too late .
Maybe the situation is too urgent .
Yes , I think I should have jumped in any case .
My name is Jung Min . What's your name ?
My name is Jessica . It's nice to meet you .
Yes . It's nice to meet you too . Are you a new student too ?
No . I'm a sophomore . I take it you are a new student ?
Yeah . It's pretty exciting to be here .
Have fun while it lasts . The excitement wears off real quick . Especially after you see how much homework you get . Where are you from ?
I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here .
I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea .
Why were you in Japan ?
My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures .
That's pretty cool .
I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents .
Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around .
Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class .
Ok .
I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today .
Do you feel ok ?
Not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu .
Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now .
Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ?
You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down .
Ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting .
Zach , what's that on your arm ?
I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing .
It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ?
Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .
I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go .
Shouldn't we make an appointment first ?
We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse .
Whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting !
Not at all . The changing rooms are just this way .
Thanks . It's a little tight . Do you have any in a larger size ?
Sure . I'll give you the next size up . That one is small , right ?
Yes . Also , I'm not so sure about the color .
Well . It doesn't go with your skirt . I think the color itself is fine though .
I hope we'll get together again soon .
I hope so . A good journey to you !
Thank you .
What did you argue about ?
He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ' t have the money yet .
Well , he should pay you back . It ' s only fair .
Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ' t have got angry .
Did you lend him a lot of money ?
Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back .
Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ' s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ?
No , we didn ' t . I guess you ' re right . We should patch things up .
Of course you should . You wouldn ' t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ?
Stay for dinner with us .
I'm afraid I can't . I have a dinner party at seven tonight . You see , I am going to England the day after tomorrow .
Well , I won't keep you then . It was very nice of you to come to see me .
It has been a pleasure . Goodbye .
Goodbye . Thank you again for coming .
Sorry , I can ' t ! I have to go to work , pick up Jake and Maddie from school , and make them an afternoon snack , then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class .
You sound exhausted . Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out ! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities . She can also help you do some household chores , and run so
Oh , I don ' t know ... it ' s hard to find the right nanny . You have to consider her previous work experience , the responsibilities you give her , and how she interacts with the kids . I would love to have
I think you should definitely consider it ! This way you won ' t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ' ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . I can refer you this great
Oh , that ' s great . Thanks Grace . Can you give me her number ? I ' ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow . Maybe this way I won ' t be so tired every day , and Dan and I might even get to go
I would like for you to come in and talk about a few more tests that I would like to run .
Does this mean that you have bad news for me ?
I just want to talk to you about the tests that I want to run .
Can ' t you just tell me now ?
I don ' t know anything for certain . We always do a double check if there is a question .
I want to see you right away .
You can come in this afternoon . If you are feeling too stressed , feel free to bring a friend along .
I know for sure that something is wrong !
Don ' t worry about a thing ; we are just taking a second look and talking .
You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table .
Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels .
Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss . Parker speaks to us only in English .
I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ?
Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said .
It must be interesting to study English .
Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss . Parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ?
Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
Certainly . What's the matter ?
I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet .
Sure . I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores .
Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ?
That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www . taobao . com or www . ebay . com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place .
Is the service charged ?
No . it's free .
Really . I'll get a computer at once .
I'll be with you in a minute .
Yeah .
Who won ?
China .
What is the score ?
China beat Brazil three to zero .
Wonderful .
It ' s nice to meet you , too .
I am happy to be speaking to a presidential candidate .
Would you like to ask me anything ?
What do you feel about gay marriage ?
I think everyone has the right to love who they want .
Would you legalize gay marriage ?
Yes , I would .
Many people won ' t like that .
I ' m sure they won ' t , but that ' s my view on gay marriage .
I really like you .
I really appreciate that .
Certainly , sir .
I'm afraid there's been a mistake .
I'm sorry , sir . What seems to be the trouble ?
I believe you have charged me twice for the same thing . Look , the figure of 6 . 5 dollar appears here , then again here .
I'll just go and check it for you , sir .
Dad , I have to do my homework .
No , honey , why didn't you go to cram school last night ?
Dad , I don't want to talk about it now .
Honey , if you don't want to go to cram school , you should tell me the reason why .
I'm sorry , dad . But I would rather stay at school than go to cram school .
Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate .
Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ?
He asked me how long it took me to learn English .
But , you were born and raised in California !
Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes .
What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ?
You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice .
So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ?
I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it .
Are you sure he really got the message ?
Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English .
That's hilarious ! What did he say ?
He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good .
I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again .
What is your address ?
I stay at No . 115 Fucking Road .
OK , a taxi will be there by 9:30 .
What are your rates ?
It is RIB 10 yuan initially and 2 yuan for each kilometer .
I have a lot of luggage . Will those fit in the taxi ?
Take it easy . I'll send a larger to pick you up .
Thank you very much .
Hi , Susan . What ' s up ?
Do you know where that memo about office procedures is ? I want to give my secretary a copy .
I ' m sorry . I have no idea . I haven ' t seen that for ages .
I think it's great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I've actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine's for a while now , but I wasn't sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment .
Um , ninety-five dollars ?
Yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ?
I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique . I didn't know I could get it cheaper somewhere else .
Of course ! Everything at Helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn't you shop around ?
I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive .
Sure . But it's a very difficult one , you need to have a dictionary at your elbow .
But I'm not used to looking up every new word when I'm reading a novel . I only look up the most necessary ones .
What's her figure ?
Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too .
What's the color of her eyes ?
Dark blue .
Not good . My cousin is driving me up the wall .
How so ?
He stays up untill all hours of the night , and he never lifts a finger to help .
Have you talk to him about it ?
Not yet , but I have to soon . He's eating me out of house and home . I caught him reading the fridge again last night
Ahahah , Maybe that will help you lose weight .
This is no laughing matter , Nick .
Sorry Paul . I couldn't help it . So why doesn't he give you a hand ?
He watch the tob too much . Now really I don't know . But I can't handle this much longer .
Well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , OK ?
Yes , I think so , If you want to graduated this year , you've got to take a science course .
Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses .
Well , I have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics . what you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors .
Yes , I really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school .
That's a problem .
It's nice to meet you , Mr . Cooper .
Nice to meet you , Ms . Wang . You must be exhausted after your long trip from Canada .
Yes , it was quite a long flight . I'm glad to finally be here .
I am great ! How about you , Mary ? How are you ?
I am doing great ! Thank you for asking , Joe .
I was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight ?
I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper .
OK . What about going to the movies on Friday night ?
What were you planning on seeing ?
I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer .
How about " The Secret Life of Bees " ?
That's a chick flick !
Yes . I ' Ve won the first prize in the math contest .
Really ? Congratulations !
Thank you , Paul .
By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday .
Good , happy birthday to you !
Not so soon . It ' s not my birthday today . Well , you ' ll come , won ' t you ?
Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me .
My pleasure .
It is in that brand new , tall building over there . On the 9th floor .
Where is the school cafeteria ?
It is the basement of that red building in front of the tower with big bells .
Where is the Computer Center ?
The Computer Center is on the first floor of the library .
Where is the library ?
The library is next to the Adminstration Building . The Adminstration Building is over there near the school ' s main entrance . There are school maps for free in the lobby of the Admin .
Thank you . I will go get one .
Sure . Glad to be of service . By the way , my name is Mike Sullivan . You will see me around a lot . I am running for President of the Student Government .
Well , hi ! My name is Eve Markowski . I am glad to meet you . With your friendly smile and helpful attitude . I am sure you will win .
Thanks you for the encouragement .
You are welcome . I ' d better go . Goodbye .
Have a good day . Bye-Bye !
So I heard .
What ' s wrong with her ?
She went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident .
I swear never to drink again . Just give me another chance , please !
How many chances have I given you ? I don ' t trust you any more .
You know how hard I've tried to give up drinking ? I ' d be lost without you . I won ' t let you go anyway .
Morning , Michael . I ' Ve been very busy lately . One of our other vendors is going out of business and I ' Ve been searching for a suitable replacement .
Well , rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run , sitdown . Coffee ?
No , thanks . I ' Ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine .
Haha , I could never do that . I ' d be a zombie if I didn ' t have my morning coffee fix . Let ' s get down to business then .
Yes . I ' Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . The demand for phone cameras is growing , and Pear has been falling behind in the market .
That ' s great ! I ' m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . Is Pear still interested in having those ?
No , we ' re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
Surely . Let ' s get started by drafting a new contract .
I'm not certain . Do you know ?
America was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 .
In a way that's right . But the Vikings travelled there long beforeColumbus . And what about the Red Indians ?
All right . Ask me a question now .
Who invented the electric light bulb ?
That's easy . It was invented by Edison .
Correct . Now for a harder question . Who will be the first men on Mars ?
I can't answer that . But I think Mars will be visited by men before theed of this century .
Ask me a question now .
All right . What is the nearest planet to the sun ?
That's easy . It's .. er . Venus . NO . Pluto . No . Wait a minute . It's Anthe tip of my tongue . Oh dear , what is the nearest planet to the sun ?
You shouldn't grab someone else's shirt . That's a foul .
Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched .
You can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees .
The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play !
Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men .
The material is so abstract that I have trouble understanding it .
I think there ' s a Western on .
Do you mind if we watch it . I ' d really like to see it .
Well , I really wanted to see the football game .
Football game ? Ok , and you know what comes on next ?
I believe there ' s a sitcom .
Are you interested in watching it ?
Let me look in the TV Guide first .
Oh , I am sorry . What's on Channel 2 at 10 pm ?
If I remember correctly , it's a quiz show .
Do you want to watch it ?
Let's watch it together .
What for ? ( Why ? )
This is the place I was telling you about .
Would you like to sit near the window ?
Good .
Let's have a look at the menu . Oh , there isn't a menu . Do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ?
Yes , of course . Excuse me . Could you possibly let us see your menu ? Oh . They haven't got one either .
I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ?
That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service .
A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ?
A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle .
But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you .
We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies .
I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free .
Terrible ! Does he want to divorce ?
I am not sure .
Don ' t lose your reason . Go to find him and talk with him .
I'm not in the mood .
It's the circus .
I don't want to sit there and watch them torturing the animals .
Oh , come on , they give them treat too . Oh , look , that little monkey is so cute .
Cute ? Hope so .
Oh , it is coming to us , come on , Ben , get a banana to it .
Me ? No way , keep him away from me , please .
Why are you acting so strange today ?
I've said that I've got a problem with the circus . I'm not kidding .
That's weird !
You can be sure of that , sir .
Thank you .
I'm sorry , sir . I'm not sure I understand .
I'm talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo .
Oh , I see . So , you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities .
No , no . I've got plenty left .
Now I'm confused again ! What is the problem ?
What am I going to do about souvenirs ?
Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs !
Yes , I've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs .
Sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items , and as a guest you get a discount .
Please ! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs .
I understand completely , sir . Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment .
Yes . They were open this morning when I came to work . They must've finished remodeling . Why do you want to know ?
Well , I thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today . That is , if you haven't promised to go with someone else .
That'd be wonderful , Peter . But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning .
I'm sorry I was such a grouch . It must've been the weather . When it rains I get depressed .
Forget it . I'll see you at 11:30 am .
What a miser ! He cycles to school every day .
His grandfather's money is not his .
I can't understand him anyway .
What ' s going to be covered in the orientation ?
The company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company ID , batch , telephone , e-mail set-up and training .
Quite a lot . All them one afternoon ?
Yes , it is not easy .
It is OK with me . I enjoy being busy and learning new things .
Me too .
Why do you hate to go outside ?
I meet too many jerks .
I agree .
This city is full of jerks .
Rude people are everywhere .
But what can you do ?
You can yell at them .
And they will yell back at you .
Yelling doesn't do any good .
No . The best thing to do is just stay home .
You can check on the bulletin boards at school for local housing .
What if I need a roommate ?
There are websites that can hook you up with a roommate .
How much do apartments cost around here ?
It depends on what you want . Do you want a one - or two-bedroom apartment ?
I just need a one-bedroom apartment .
That will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month .
Would you come with me to look at apartments ?
I would be happy to look at apartments with you .
Not bad . We have had a big meeting today , remember ?
Oh , yea . I forgot . So how did it go ?
Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas .
Great , so what happens now ?
Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it .
Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .
How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .
What ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
Let's hope so .
Do you have any seats for September 16th ?
Let's see ... I'm afraid the 16th is fully booked . But I have seats for the 17th .
The 17th will be fine .
And what date will you be returning ?
Hmm , I guess on the 28th .
Okay , you're booked on American Airlines flight 710 , departing JFK at 6
Sounds good . Thanks a lot .
No , I think Harry will get it .
Let's make a bet on who gets it .
OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night .
You can place the smaller one in the overhead bin and put the bigger one under the seat in front of you .
Thank you very much .
Please make sure to fasten your seat belt . We are to take off .
Not hot but warm . Very comfortable .
Are you staying at the Hilton ?
Yes , I have already booked a room .
Yes , my friends like to get along with me well .
Do you have many friends ?
Yes , I like to make new friends .
What do you usually do with them ?
We like to get together , chat and enjoy beautiful music .
Not much . Just sitting here eating some Chinese food . Is that the paper ? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ?
Ok , wait a minute ... let's see . I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me .
What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ?
Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful .
That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day .
But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope .
I don't know if anything terrible has happened .
I have reported it to the police .
We'd better prepare for the worst .
I ' m having a problem .
What problem are you having ?
There have been charges made on my debit card that I didn ' t make .
Do you have the statement for your card ?
Here it is .
What are the charges you ' re referring to ?
The last four charges on the page .
I ' m afraid we ' re going to have to investigate these charges .
How long will an investigation take ?
I honestly don ' t know , but we will freeze payment on these charges .
That sounds absolutely fantastic .
Sure . What's up ?
Certainty . Do you want double breasted suit or single breasted suit ?
I prefer single breasted suit .
What about this one ? It's a very nice 3 - piece suit .
That looks great . Do you have ties here ?
I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ?
Sure . No problem .
Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ?
Sure . Do you have my number ?
Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this .
No problem . I'll wait for your call .
Yes , do I have to work a whole year before I can take a vacation ?
Yes , after you ' Ve been here a year , you qualify for a three-day vacation
Only three days ?
That's the company policy .
What happens if I use up my sick days before the end of the year ? If I ' m sick an extra day or two , will my pay be deducted ?
Yes . That's the company policy .
It was the same as the last place I worked at . I was hoping you ' d be different .
Really ? How did you get the chance ?
You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ' t have to pay for my trip .
Congratulations . How lucky you are !
Thank you . I ' m leaving tomorrow morning .
I ' m sure you ' ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country .
I ' m sure I will .
Have a nice journey , Lily .
Thank you , David .
It ' s too loud .
We ' Ve been looking around for many hours . What on earth are you looking for ?
Well , you know , those styles or colors don ' t suit me .
What style do you want ?
I want to buy a V-neck checked sweater , and it should be tight .
Oh , I see . How about the color ?
Quiet color .
I know a shop selling this kind of sweaters .
Really ? Let ' s go there .
Yes , good morning . This is Mr . Suzuki from Video TV . May I speak to Mr . Johnson ?
I'm sorry , but Mr . Johnson is out at the moment . Can I take a message ?
Uh , yes , okay . Tell him John Suzuki called . That's S-U-Z-U-K-I .
Yes .
From Video TV .
Yes , Video TV .
Tell him I telephoned . I'd like to see him about the videotapes . Can he call me this afternoon ?
Yes , Of course . What's your telephone number ?
It's , area code 413 , 447-9626 .
That is 413-447-9662 ?
No , that's 447-9626 .
Oh , I'm sorry , 447-9626 .
Yes , that's right . Extension 162 .
Extension 162 . Okay , Mr . Suzuki . I'll give him the message .
Thank you . Good-bye .
Good-bye .
Yeah , you can count on it .
I think so . Yes , they get along so well .
I like him . He's good for her .
You're right . He sure is .
I am looking for a pair of shoes .
Do you like high heels or flat shoes ?
High hells , please . I want to wear them in formal situations .
Yes , that's right .
I believe we met at a concert last year . I'm Taylor .
Oh , yes . I remember .
I don't know . It's a rental .
I will give you premium unleaded . Alright ?
Sure , why not ?
That is the pump you are in front of .
Is it expensive ?
It is the most expensive .
Well , I don't want it then . Can I move to another pump ?
Yes , I can give you regular unleaded . But you have to back up the car a little .
Give me regular unleaded then . I will back up . Can you wash my windows for me ?
I'm sorry , sir . This is not a full service gas station . I will help you fill the gas , but we don't wash windows here .
Really ? Well , I guess I have to get used to it .
Five . My father , mother , brother , sister-in-law and me .
Is your brother older or younger than you ?
He is five years older than me , He got married last Sunday . My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age .
You see , I've been offered a new job . I can't decide whether to take it or not .
Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice .
It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging .
Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ?
Yes , they say I would get a big sum .
Have you discussed it with your wife ?
Yes , she leaves it to me .
As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary .
I have to think about it .
Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink .
How about the new bar across the road ?
Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too .
I agree , I had lunch there last week .
Excellent ! That sounds like a plan .
Nothing really , why , what ' s up ?
If you are free , maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . It will be fun , you will get to know lots of people .
Sounds great , I'd very much like to accept your invitation , thanks , when ?
Around six pm .
Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating .
No . thank you . I can handle it , but thanks for the offer .
Ok , I will see you then .
Great , have a good day , thanks again for the offer .
Where are you going ?
I told you already ! I ' m going to get my nails done .
Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ?
Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me !
Why ? I don ' t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
They don ' t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do .
It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight .
What about a draft at 120 days sight ?
All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us .
A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due .
Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible .
I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries .
So do I .
What do you have in mind ?
A dessert sounds nice .
What kind are you thinking of getting ?
I want to get some pie .
What kind of pie do you want ?
I have no idea .
Do you want to know what kind of pie I like ?
Sure , what kind do you like ?
I love apple pie .
Oh , I love apple pie too .
There you go . Problem solved .
Unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford .
Why is the price so high ?
It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly .
Model of computers aren't compatible ?
Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities .
Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable .
But by then , the technology will be outdated .
True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge .
That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable .
This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product .
I guess you get what you pay for .
Yes , what do you want to know ?
The information is scanty for me . And can you describe the responsibilities of the position ?
Yes . Copywriters are supposed to design and write articles for the advertising company .
Mr Green , please .
Sorry , he's out .
What time you suspect back them ?
Sorry , I am not sure , can I take a message ?
No , thanks . I'll call back later .
That's fine . please call again later .
Ok , thank you . Goodbye .
Heard what ?
Deborah already had her baby .
I didn't know that .
I thought you knew .
I honestly didn't know .
The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .
That's good to hear .
Will you go and visit them ?
Of course I will .
I just wanted to give you the good news .
Thanks for letting me know .
Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ' s really annoying !
Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ' s why the parking lot was flooded .
I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
Eh , so so .
And this one ? Too flashy ?
Nah , not too flashy .
Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ' t it hideous ?
I guess .
Are you even listening ? I ' m trying to have a conversation with you .
And I ' m trying to watch the game , but you ' re yapping on about your new clothes !
Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon !
Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ' s the third quarter and you ' Ve been blabbering on since the first !
Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
Oh no you didn ' t . You didn ' t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ' t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game !
It will leave at 3:00 p . m .
When does it arrive ?
It should be due in at 7:30 a . m . tomorrow .
How much is the ticket ?
It's 86 coach and 175 berths
One berth , please .
I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward . It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive .
What things impress you in your colleagues ?
I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment .
What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ?
The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior .
How do you organize and plan for major projects ?
I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario . Then , I set a timetable that's realistic . What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react .
Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure .
I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks . The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me . Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed .
How do you manage your time in a typical day ?
I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value . The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week .
Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion .
I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings .
Well , on weekdays I get up around ten . Then I read the paper for an hour and have lunch at about noon .
Really ? What time do you go to work ?
I start work at three .
And when do you get home at night ?
I get home pretty late , around midnight .
So what do you do , exactly ?
I'm a TV announcer . Don't you recognize me ? I do the weather report on KNT !
Gee , I'm sorry . I don't watch TV .
Not really . I could take it or leave it .
Not me . I have to have my TV and watch whatever comes on .
How can you do that ?
Engaged ? She ' s married .
Johnny , I wish you ' d stop reaching for things . Haven ' t you a tongue ?
Yes , Mother , but my arm is longer .
Yes , they are shy and gentle but very powerful .
You are right . They sweep Nancy off her feet . And now she fell head over heels in love with him .
How wonderful it would be if I had such smiles !
No , I don't .
Shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks ?
That sounds like a good idea .
I know a very interesting place .
Oh , do you ? Good .
It sure is .
It's a good day for a picnic .
Yes , I know a great place . What types of food do you like ?
Mexican , Japanese or Chinese would be great .
Oh , I know a place where you might like to eat .
Is it close by ?
It's down a block on the right ; can I show you the way ?
OK , I'd love the company .
This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it .
All right . Which room shall I have ?
Room 202 , but I'm afraid we have to ask for a deposit of $ 200 .
Which train do you like ?
T112 to Washington please .
May I have your name ?
That's Lincoln .
Yeah , almost . But there is one thing .
What ?
I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ...
What is it ?
Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others .
That makes you feel uncomfortable ?
Yeah . we never do that in a public office .
Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy .
I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding .
Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus .
Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ?
Yeah .
Oh , I'm shocked .
Hum ... Why not go shopping the day after tomorrow ? Tomorrow is Saturday . I hate all the hustle and bustle of Saturday shopping .
But Sunday is the same with Saturday . If you don ' t mind , that's OK .
Hum . Maybe it will be better . The most important thing is that I can have a day to relax after a week's work .
I see . We will go the day after tomorrow .
By the way , what kind of stores do we need to go ?
I want to buy some clothes in clothing store . When we are going back , go to the butcher's shop and buy some chicken .
Let ' s also go to the jewelry store to buy a crystal necklace . I want to buy one for you as your birthday present .
Thank you , darling .
I'm allergic to these things , you know .
Sorry , I forgot . I don ' t like seafood , neither .
Let ' s go over there and get some milk , a couple dozen eggs and some orange juice .
Let's get frozen juice . It is really good . We ' Ve got enough food . Let ' s go over to the check-out stand .
OK . But just let me pick up a bottle of cooking wine and oil as we go by .
Don ' t be kidding , OK ?
What ' s the matter ? So angry . I ' m just playing a joke with you .
Because I have given him up as a bad job . Our relation has been over .
What's your excuse this time ?
Have I used the one that my sister is sick ?
Yes , twice last week .
Are you sure ? I thought I said it was my mother .
I don't think so . But it could've been .
Well . You can trust me this time . My sister is definitely sick . I'm just coming from the hospital . They say she might even die .
I don't buy your story . Try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ?
I'll do my best .
Just try to be a little more punctual in the future .
I'm working on it . Really !
Cool ! Flashy red lines !
I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned .
Is it waterproof ?
Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am .
Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ?
Well , surfing , scuba diving ...
There is the Balance of Net Liabilities . This must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years .
Right , OK . That , again , shouldn't be a problem .
And the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average , for that particular industry , for the first two quarters of the year .
Well , as far as I can tell , we qualify .
Of course we will need proof , originals and duplicate of everything . As soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed .
You really should go to Rachel's pet store .
Why ? anything special there ?
It's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more .
Oh , really ? are there any snakes ?
Snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .
That's terrific . I can't wait to check it out .
Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?
Why not ? it's so cool .
But it will pose a risk to your health .
Pardon ?
I mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems .
Well , I didn't realize that .
I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .
Oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .
Yes , good luck , Maria .
I'd like a beer . What kind of beer do you have ?
Draft beer and cans beer . Which do you prefer ?
A draft beer please .
OK . Here you are .
Could I have some fruit ?
Of course . Wait for a moment , please .
I feel eggplants are more nutritious .
But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .
Oh , that's how you see it .
Some what ?
Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat .
No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?
Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like .
Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?
Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered .
What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste .
Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag .
No , never . I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes .
That's right . Seeing is believing .
I've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement .
That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear .
What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password .
It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough .
I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping .
Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .
That's a good idea .
That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it .
Certainly .
Yes , I've been waiting for my bags to be sent up for the last half hour . Where are they ?
I'm very sorry to hear that . May I have your name and room number , please ?
Yes , it's Yao Lan . Room 406 .
And how many pieces did you have ?
Two suitcases and a handbag . The suitcases are blue and the shoulder bag is red .
Is there a name tag attached to them ?
Yes , there is .
We're very sorry for the delay . I'll check immediately and call you back .
Let me see . Laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture lotion , ... Oh , that is too much . You are not going to a business trip .
I guess I need all of them .
Actually , the company will provide you with all of these supplies . So , you can leave this very thick notebook at home .
I know . But it is my lucky charm . I carry it all the time .
Suit yourself . Don ' t forget to set the alarm clock .
why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that .
well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers .
do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ?
no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions .
it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America .
religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal .
what do you think about abortion ?
I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself .
do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?
I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children .
why not ? It's their children , too .
that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand .
that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter .
May I see your ticket please ?
Here you are . Do you need to see my passport ?
Any form of picture I . D . will do .
Mmmm ... a photo I . D . I have my New Jersey driver ' s license . Is that ok ?
That will do . What an interesting picture ! How old is it ?
Actually it wad taken just last year , but I had a shaved head and a beard . Can you still recognize me ?
Barely . Will you be checking any luggage today ?
Yes , One suitcase . I also have a carry-on bag .
Ok . Mr . Lee , you ' re all set . Your flight leaves from gate 10 . Boarding begins at 10:30
Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired .
With the job ?
With everything , with everybody , with all this !
A good suggestion for you . You need a holiday .
It wasn't always like this , you know .
What do you mean ?
Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives .
You need a holiday . That's what's the matter .
Certainly , perhaps .
Yes , I packed it myself , and it hasn ' t been out of my possession .
Are you bringing in any plants or animal products ?
No .
Our sniffer dog seems to disagree . Do you mind if we look in your suitcase ?
Not at all . Go right ahead .
What ' s this sir ?
It ' s traditional Chinese Medicine . I mix it with hot water like tea . Sorry . I forgot about it .
What are these red things sir ?
Oh no ! I forgot about those too ! Those are Chinese sausages for my Aunt Lily .
I ' m sorry sir , but you can ' t take any of this into the country . We will also have to check your carry-on . Please step this way . Don ' t ' be nervous ; we ' ll just look through it briefly and then
I would like to return some books .
I ' ll take them .
Here you go .
These books were due two weeks ago .
Yeah . I totally forgot they were due .
You will need to pay late fees on these books .
How much are the late fees ?
The fee is 25 cents every day .
I have to pay 25 cents a day ?
And that ' s for each book that is late .
That shouldn ' t be a problem .
What is it ?
Can you mail this at the post office for me ? I have to go to the doctor for an appointment and I don't have enough time to go to the post office .
Sure . And I'd like you to get some cold medicine for me when you go to the doctor's .
I'd like to have it in big waves .
Shall I put some oil on ? B
I'd like to speak to Michael Baker , please .
I'm sorry , Mr . Baker is not in . May I take a message ?
Yes . Tell him Mr . Cook called and ask him to return my call soon as he gets back .
All right , Mr . Cook . I'll have Mr . Baker call you back as soon as he gets here .
Anything you would like to know ?
What qualities do you expect the applicants to have ?
We expect the usher girl to be good-looking , no less than 165 centimeters high , and love smiling .
All right , madam . When I was sales manager at the Beijing Friendship Store . I succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 % and profit margins from 50 % to 80 % .
That is quite an achievement ! Do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
I don't think so . I'll create further achievement in the future .
Have you received any honors ?
Yes . I got the title of " Advance Worker " in 2006 .
Do you have any publications ?
Yes . I wrote a thesis entitled " On Interpersonal Relations in the Socialist Market Economy " and it was published in China Daily .
Well , I swim and run every day .
Now , tell me , what do you eat ?
Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .
Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
What do you drink ?
Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
No ! My tour bus got a speeding ticket not ten minutes ago . Now my engine is on fire !
I think that's just steam . Your engine's overheated .
Do you know a lot about cars ?
A little bit . I'll take a look if you want me to .
Please . Thank you so much for stopping .
Yeah , she's hot . Radiator's leaking . Looks like you were running her pretty hard .
That must have been just before I got the speeding ticket .
Did you have an accident recently ... Hey , wait a second ! I know this car !
You do ?
I ran into it a couple of weeks ago . What do you know ? Name's Hal .
I'm Akimbo . Nice to meet you , I guess .
Boy , I'm sure sorry about your car . Hey , Akimbo , I wonder if you'd like to make a deal ?
What kind of deal ?
I'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car .
You don't want your insurance company to pay for it ?
I'd rather not . They'll raise my rates . It'll cost me more in the long run .
If you give me cash , do you care if I don't fix the car ?
Hell , I don't care . Just don'T submit a report to your insurancecompany .
It's a deal , Hal . Thanks again for stopping to help . And thanks for smashing my car !
Oh , don't mention it . It was terrible .
What ' the matter ?
The food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone .
I see . You simply can't blame the server for this .
Yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district .
That's true .
Anyway , how was your such , Catherine ?
It was good . I brought lunch from home today .
You did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America .
Well , I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy .
I guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat .
Yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , don't you ?
You bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America .
Well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places .
Seriously ?
Yeah , it's hard to believe but true .
Yes , is that you , Allen ?
Yes , how are you doing ?
Not bad .
Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening . Would you like to come with me ?
Sure . Thank you very much .
Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty . OK ?
Ok , see you .
See you .
Sorry , all the tables for three are reserved .
Do you have a table for four , please ?
Yes , smoking or non-smoking ?
We'd like a non-smoking table , please .
Come with me , please .
Sure , but let's get a pitcher this time We should be able to down it before they close .
That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ?
It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ?
Yeah . I think I can find it .
You're back already . That sure was quick .
That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me .
Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . Anyway . He said it was too close to closing time .
Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway .
Okay , let's go !
No , what ?
He's got a promotion .
You're kidding .
No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years .
Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul .
Well . Good for him .
Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman .
How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother .
I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself .
Does your husband feel the same ?
Yes . He is very understanding and supportive .
I was born and raised in Beijing . I attended Peking University and received my bachelor's degree in Economics . I have worked for 2 years as a financial consultant in Beijing for China Pacific Insurance Co . Ltd .
What type of position are you looking for ?
I'm looking for a position in which I can utilize my experience .
Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position ?
I am more interested in a full-time position . However , I would also consider a part-time position .
Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ?
I advised customers on financial matters . After I consulted the customer , I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis .
What is your greatest strength ?
I am an excellent communicator . People trust me and come to me for advice . One afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
What is your greatest weakness ?
I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . However , I began setting time-limits for myself .
Why do you want to work for our company ?
After following your firm's progress for the last 3 years , I am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and I would like to be a part of that team .
When can you begin ?
Immediately .
Red cooked carp and rape with fresh mushrooms .
What about soup ?
Sour-peppery soup .
Which condiment do you use for ?
I'll use ginger , garlic scallion , hot pepper and vinegar .
Very good , need I help you ?
No , don't need , I can do myself .
Thanks . I can watch TV now .
But you must cook that dinner next time .
Okay , I'll do it next time .
Come on ! You're pulling my leg .
Really ! Here's my trophy .
Wow ! Congratulations !
It was a real red letter day for you .
Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Ms . Smith . I ' m Jack Stevens from the Marketing Department . Here is my card .
It ' s nice to meet you , Mr . Stevens .
Please call me Jack . Have a seat , please .
Thank you .
Does the class start again , Mam ?
Yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough .
Oh , breaktime flies .
Come on , baby . It ' s time now .
Mam , another minute , could I ?
Hurry up , little boy .
He's going to turn six next month .
Who is looking after him ?
My mother-in - law . She retired last year .
You really are lucky !
Yeah , I know .
Welcome . One of your duties is to know the number of the customer and accept reservation .
What else do I need to do ?
You inform the people in charge and let them reserve dinning tables for guests .
Oh , I can't . I have a date !
Really ? Wow with who ?
This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months . She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend .
Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ?
Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat .
That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ?
It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy .
I guess it does seem logical . I'll have to check it out !
What's up , Robert ?
Cafe au lait , cafe latte , cappuccino , cafe mocha ... I can't keep them all straight !
Slow down . What are you talking about ?
It's about a girl . No , an angel ! I'm going to the coffee shop where she works right now .
What's wrong with it ?
What's wrong with it ? It's filthy !
Oh ...
It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
Sorry , love .
What are you looking for now ?
My cigarettes .
Well , they ' re not here . They are in the dustbin .
In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ?
Charles Dickens . Actually no one can parallel him in writing .
I'm afraid I can't agree with you on that . I like D . H . Laurence ' s novels better .
Did you send in your Continued Claim Form for the last period ?
I think I forgot to send it in !
You need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid .
Can I send it in now ?
You should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due . If it hasn ' t been , we will still accept it .
Can I mail it in early next time so it isn ' t late ?
Actually , you cannot mail it in early , as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date .
Will my paycheck come right away now ?
Your check will arrive a little late .
I would like to report a break-in .
When was this break-in ?
I believe it happened last night .
Where was the break-in ?
It happened at my house .
Was anything stolen ?
I haven't checked yet .
Why do you think there was a break-in ?
My front window was broken .
We'll send a squad car shortly .
I'd appreciate that .
Very well . We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . The only thing that isn ' t ready yet is my wedding dress .
When will that be ready ?
The dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks .
You ' re getting married in three weeks . So that should be ok . So , you ' Ve prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel-everything .
Yes . We ' Ve taken care of all of that . We decided not to get married in a church though . Neither of us is very religious .
Which hotel will the reception be held at ?
The palace hotel they ' re taking care of the catering , including the wedding cake . I ' m sure they ' ll do a good job .
Oh , yes . It ' s and excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
Yes . It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . It gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people .
I think you make the right decision .
We have thought of you carefully with discretion , but the other candidate has more experiences .
Experience is important , but don't you think capability is more valuable than that ?
Yes , I think so . But how do you prove to me that you are more capable ?
Maybe you can hire me on trial . If I'm not qualified for the job , you can let me go .
Good idea .
That's great .
Now let's get things ready .
Don't worry . There are all kinds of things in the center .
That's much more convenient . We don't even have to bring the flavorings .
Sure . What kind of skin do you have ?
My skin is oily .
Then I advise you to buy the LAY cleansing milk .
Can you tell me more ?
Yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day .
Good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time .
Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ...
Is everything ready now ?
Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive .
Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .
Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet .
It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ' t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available .
Thank you .
My pleasure .
Yes , here you are .
How much is it ?
It's free of charge .
Thanks so much .
Yeah , I really wanted that Chanel bag , too . But just in case you should bid low .
But there are only two more days until the bidding closes !
I bid on a Chanel watch at the last minute , and got it sixty percent off !
Oh ... I'm such a newbie . But at least I'm sure I'll get that tennis racket .
Don't count on it , Babe . eBay is always full of surprises .
Well ... guess how low the bidding starts on the tennis racket ?
Why do you say so ? Everyone admires that you have a good wife .
Oh , no . When we were poor , we often tried our best to make ends meet . It was a hard time .
But now you are rich .
And we have some squabbles on some boring things .
This is ordinary marriage life .
Sure . What do you want to find ?
I want to find information on the American Civil War .
Well , can you be more specific ? There are a lot of websites about that .
Yes , I want to know about the battle of Gettysburg .
O . K . Well , go to google . com , and type in " Battle of Gettysburg . "
Oh wow , there are a lot of sites .
Here , try this one . It ' s a good site about Gettysburg .
Thanks .
For detailed information , however , you should read a history book .
Thanks . If I ' m interested , I ' ll go to the library .
Sure . The coach leaves at 6:30 a . m . , in front of our office . The drive takes eight hours , with two stops to see some sights .
What about the hotel accommodations ?
You'll be staying at Holiday Inn . It's a three-star hotel with two restaurants and a swimming pool .
Great . What types of things will we do at Lushun Falls ?
The second day you take a four-hour city tour . In the afternoon you go on the famous boat cruise under the falls .
Don't worry . We'll make it back to the camp site before dark .
I sure hope so .
I had it right here a minute ago , Mr . Emory . Umm . Just a minute ...
Christine , I know you ' re new here and there ' s a lot to learn , but you are going to have to learn to keep your work in better order . We can ' t afford to lose an important document .
Yes , sir . I apologize for that . Here ' s the file you were looking for , Mr . Emory .
So am I .
Where should we go eat today ?
How about we go eat in the cafeteria ?
I never bought food from the cafeteria .
You haven't ? They have a lot of good stuff .
What do they have ?
They sell everything .
Well , I want Chinese food .
I've gotten chow mein from there before .
I guess we can eat there then .
Trust me , the food isn't half bad .
But I haven't used exercising equipment before . Can you tell us some more details ?
Certainly . We have here the race apparatus , stationary bike , muscle builder set , chest expander , bar bell , dumb bell and so on .
Working in the gym is a very good way for losing weight . What else do you have ?
Here's the swimming pool . It's open from 10 a . m . to 11 p . m . There are also massage rooms here .
That's wonderful ! I like swimming .
sure I am . I've been writing a blog for almost three years .
oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ?
I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides .
what do you usually write about ?
at first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my family an
that's interesting . How often do you write a blog ?
it's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks .
got it . Are you still updating your blog ?
sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like .
good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months .
Yes , sir . What can I do for you ?
I want to buy some specialties . Can you recommend me some ?
Sure . I strongly advise you to buy a bottle of perfume and a lighter .
Fine . They look nice . I will take both of them .
May I have a look at your passport , please ?
I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator .
We need an operator now .
It's just the job I've been searching for .
That ' s great . He ' s the best runner I ' Ve seen this season . I ' m sure he ' ll win a medal at the Olympics .
I think you ' re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we ' ll win ?
I really don ' t know . I don ' t think we ' ll win many gold medals , but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones .
What do you think our chance are in other events .
In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ' ll do well in those same events .
We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice .
I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total .
You are very optimistic !
Of course , they are out there .
But I never saw them .
Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them .
You mean that you can them .
That's right . I can see them in my dreams .
They come to the earth ?
No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space .
Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ?
OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings .
That means that you talk to them ? In which language ?
Of course in English , they learn English on Mars too .
Wow . Sounds fantastic !
Thank you .
Is that your wedding ring ?
I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring .
Well , congratulations . When is the big date ?
In June .
Did you have the watch before getting the ring ?
Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch .
You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous .
Thank you so much .
What kind of watch is it ?
It's a Tag Heer .
If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ?
This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .
That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for .
Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .
I ' m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ' s very fast for a kid his age .
He ' s not very good at the long jump though , is he ?
He ' s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ' s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ' s fine for someone his age .
Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?
The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
How are they at swimming ?
They ' re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ' s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ' re not very fast , but that ' s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
I ' d be afraid to jump from that height !
I think that these kinds haven ' t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher .
It seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further .
Oh , yes . Mother's Day is coming . Do you plan to buy anything ?
Of course . I want to buy some night cream for my mom , and some masques for myself .
Hmm . In Carrefour , Clinique will be promoting their visible skin renewed cream .
How much is it ?
180 yuan , and you can get a free 8 piece gift package .
What's included in the gift package ?
Some black mascara , moisturizing orion , eye cream crystal lipstick , a two color eye shadow pack , styling hairspray , and a cosmetics bag .
Sounds not bad .
Yes , here is the table , which plans do you like best ?
The seven-days trip shall be fine . How much is this tour ?
$ 300 .
We will take the trip . Could you give us a pamphlet ?
Here you are .
I've never gotten one . Have you ?
I got a ticket yesterday .
Really ? What did you get one for ?
I parked in the red zone .
Why did you do that ?
I needed to get something really quick .
Where did you park at ?
At my apartment building .
Don't you have your own parking spot ?
I needed to be fast .
That was very lazy of you .
Hello , yes , I ' d like to open a bank account .
Certainly , I can can help you with that . What type of account would you like to open ? A chequing or a savings account ?
What What features do they offer ?
Well , if you just take a look here , see , with our chequing account , you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee , and our savings account has a higher interest rate , but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars .
I see , well , I think I ' m more interested in a chequing account . I like to have easy access to my money .
Alright , then , with this chequing account you ' ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . Will you require overdraft protection ? There is an extra fee for that .
No , that won ' t be necessary .
In that case , I ' ll get you to fill out this paperwork . I ' ll need your social insurance number , and two pieces of government ID . If you could just sign here , and here , and here . we ' ll be all set . Would you like to make a deposit today ?
Yes , I ' d like to deposit one billion dollars .
George , how can we ? Vacations cost money . And this month we don ' t have much money left after paying the rent .
Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ' t cost much .
Where will we sleep , then ?
In the van .
What about other expenses ?
Let ' s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ' t spend much . Come on . Don ' t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ' t we ?
Maybe you ' re right . When do you plan to go ?
The sooner the better ! I can ' t wait !
Oh , I don ' t know where we ' re going yet .
As long as we ' re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time .
Let ' s go to Chicago . We can have lunch in Chinatown . Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field !
You have such good ideas !
Yes , I'm in a bit of a rush . Could I have a piece of apple pie please ?
Certainly . Would you like it with ice cream ?
No , thanks .
What'd you like , madam ?
Two muffins and a cup of coffee . Will it take long ?
No , just a few minutes .
Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch .
But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ?
If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun .
No problem . Now , do you prefer working with others or flying solo ?
Actually , I enjoy both .
So , what is most important to you in a job ? Do you need job security or professional growth and a chance to advance ?
I need job security .
Would you be able to relocate ?
I am open to relocating .
What are your annual salary requirements ?
I need at least 75,000 per year .
I ' ll keep that in mind . Thank you for coming in today . We ' ll be in touch .
Turn left at the second light and then go straight for two blocks .
Is it far ?
No . it ' s only five minutes walk . you can ' t miss it .
Thanks a lot
You are welcome
That's over on Callaway Street , isn't it ?
Yes , but I can't find Callaway Street .
Walk that way for about four blocks . The hotel's about two blocks north of there .
Thanks a lot .
Not at all .
I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday .
Where did you spend your holiday ?
I went to Paris .
Alps , suppose .
Oh , yes , you like skiing .
Right .
Don't be so angry . It's passed anyway .
I can't forget it .
You'd better cool yourself down first .
Um yes . I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni , olives , and extra cheese .
We have a two-for-one special on large pizzas . Would you like a large pizza instead ?
Sure , that sounds good .
Great ! Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ?
No , make the second one with ham , pineapple and green peppers . Oh , and make it thin crust .
Okay , thin crust . Your total is $ 21 . 50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ' s free !
Perfect . Thank you . Bye ..
wait ! ! I need your address !
What's so great about it ?
What do you mean ? It's a scrim .
Not to me , I wouldn't be caught dead in that .
I love that kind of stuff .
Yeah , you seem to like those styles .
Sure do . I get a kick out of looking punk .
This one looks really expensive though .
I don't care how much it costs . I'm rolling in it .
Lucky you ! I can't buy anything else . I'm flat broke .
I got a replace my party outfit , I trashed it last week .
Why did you drag me into this ? I've spent a week salary .
Are you on the level ? You're the one who called me , remember ?
Just joking , Tonia . I've got some wonderful clothes . Let's go and have a close look at your outfit .
It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .
Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .
Neither am I . So a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area ?
I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
How much do you think the rent will be ?
I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
It's very nice . There are only four people , and those girls are very kind and friendly .
Well , do you all major in the same subject ?
No , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating .
That's great !
She does have a heart of gold .
You can say that again .
It is 15 minutes ' drive .
What companies do we have in our neighborhood ?
Mitsubishi , HP , IBM and many other famous corporations .
Does the 7th floor belong to our company too ?
Yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building .
It ' s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ?
Yes , at the end of the hall .
I'm going to the hospital to see Susan .
I saw her yesterday . She was a little better .
Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there ?
No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital .
Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ?
Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus .
Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 .
But number 13 buses leave from the center of town . You ' ll have to walk two miles to catch one .
Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worried . What ' s on your mind ?
We need to talk .
Okay ...
I ' Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people .
What ? Why ? I mean , we ' Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ' re happy together , aren ' t we ?
That ' s just it , I ' m not happy anymore , Tim . It ' s not you , it ' s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
So , what are you saying ? You ' re breaking up with me because I ' m perfect ?
Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ' ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ' d only hurt you , I know I ' d only make you cry .
Baby , come on . Don ' t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ' t leave me .
I can ' t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ' m only doing this for you . I don ' t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do .
Laura ...
Here are your keys . I ' ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ' m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ' ll always love you . Goodbye .
My name is Steven . I'm the Sales Manager of this company .
Well , look here . Ten new typewriters were delivered to my company yesterday afternoon and only five of them work properly .
Oh , I'm sorry about that .
Never mind being sorry , what are you going to do about it ?
Don't worry , we'll soon fix them .
Good , I hope you'll make sure that it won't happen again .
I'll certainly look into that .
Thank you . Goodbye .
I ' m sorry , Mr . Myers . I ' Ve just been so busy today .
I really don ' t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ' re running a busy office here . You ' re going to have to keep up .
You ' re right , sir . I apologize . I ' ll get those files for you now .
That's because Americans love sitcoms .
Sitcoms ?
Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values .
In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies .
I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time .
I'm glad to see you !
Sit down , please . Maybe you have read the contract , but I want to give you the details again before you sign the contract . You must have a three-month internship .
Yes , I know .
When you become a permanent employee , you will have the insurances . You will get monthly pay and will be on eight-hour / day work shift .
Wait , will I have five insurances and one fund ?
Yes . You can also enjoy legal holidays and year-end bonus .
It sounds great !
If you need to work overtime , you will get twice the usual salary as overtime pay .
OK .
You have read the relevant terms of the contract . Do you have other questions ?
How long will the induction training be ?
About two weeks .
I see .
If you don't have other questions , just sign here .
OK .
Why don't you try Chinese herbal medicine ?
Is it useful for me ?
You have to try at least .
OK . Thanks a lot .
That's nothing .
Josh and I were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we'd drop by .
I am so glad that you decided to stop by !
Yes , it has been a long time since we have seen you .
Mary , can I get Josh or you something to drink ?
Oh no , thank you . We aren't all that thirsty .
How about a little snack then ?
No , thank you , we just ate lunch a little while ago .
Well then , how is your family ?
Everyone is doing great . My sister finally had her baby .
It's Gone With the Wind .
Why do you like it best ?
I enjoy the various characters and the plot .
Well . I like the Thom Birds best .
Is it very interesting ?
Sure . I like the writer's language , too .
If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book .
Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
That's a good idea . Let's go !
Oh , yes . You ?
Yes . What did you think of it ?
I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it . What did you think of it ?
Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ?
Mmm . That's what I thought too . I really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . And I always enjoy watching Pierce Brosnan .
Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ?
Not as much as last time , actually . What's the name of the American actor who was in the supporting role ?
Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . Did you like him ?
Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together , don't you think ?
I don't know . I think the woman was better . She provided a good love interest . Lucky James Bond !
Yes !
You don't need to introduce yourself , Yang . You're famous .
Well , thank you very much but I thought l'd try and chair the meeting by the rule -- at least for a while .
OK , OK !
Now , I'd like to get things under way . The main topic on today's agenda is the development of a U . S . sales strategy for the new EBB . I'd like to hear all of your ideas , Mr . Wall , you seem in top form today . Could you start the ball rolling ?
Uh , oh , sure . Well , I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising .
Well , that's kind of obvious .
Give me a break , Mr Yang .
Uh , let's keep this going , shall we ?
Swimming in summer and skating in winter . What ' s your favorite sport ?
Jogging and bowling . Do you know how to practise Bungfu ?
No I don't But l do Taijiquan or Shadow boxing . People everywhere in China usually do Taijiquan early in the morning . It can help people keep fit . It has a history of over three hundred years .
Is it easy to learn ?
Yes . it is I can teach you if you like .
Thank you . I can teach you how to bowl .
Right . Let's help each other .
I think it ' s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to London , so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway .
that ' s unless there is a traffic jam . It could take three hours .
you ' re right . We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up areas .
so , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ?
ok . You haven ' t seen my company car , have you ?
no . let me take a look ... it ' s longer than my car .
I think it ' s over five meters long . I can ' t remember exactly . It has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour .
wow ! That ' s fast ! I don ' t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway .
we can ' t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit .
When is it ?
It falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month .
Could you tell me the origin of the two festivals ?
OK . The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan . On that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river .
Why do people eat rice cakes on that day ?
In order to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body .
It sounds so moving .
Yeah , but have you made an appointment ahead ?
Yes , of course . I am Monica . I have made an appointment with your HR manager .
Just a minute please . I ' ll make a call to the HR office . Yes , they confirm your appointment . Please come in . it is on the 3rd floor , room 3106 . You can take the right elevator as the left on is in maintenance today .
Thank you very much .
You ' re welcome .
It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months .
How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn .
I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day .
Is it really worth paying for ?
I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter .
If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
Yes , please .
Will this table be all right ?
Actually , I'd like a booth by the window if that's possible .
Certainly . How about this one ?
This will be fine , thanks .
( Handing her a menu ) Your waiter will be here in a minute to take your order .
Thank you .
Yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit .
Really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work .
It's important to do proper exercises .
You're right . Too much or too little won't do any good .
The trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
Sounds reasonable .
We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
And fruits !
Surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .
I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
Yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can also help one to keep sound physical health .
I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .
You bet it !
Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night .
Yes , Mum .
Cross the street and walk two blocks west . You can't miss it .
Thanks .
Yes ? I'll be very glad if I could be of any help to you .
An hour ago , I bought this vase with my tourist .
Oh , yes . I remember it clearly . Is there anything wrong with it ?
I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel .
Oh , how awful ! Let me have a look , I'm terribly sorry . It was most thoughtless of me . Would you excuse me , please ?
Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes .
It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ?
All right . Thank you .
Just a minute , please . I won't be long . I'm sure this one is perfect . You may examine it carefully .
Oh , yes , it is . I'll take this one .
I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you .
Well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing .
Sure , what ' s up ?
Some of us are going to start a soccer team . Would you like to join us ?
I don ' t know anything about it . Soccer isn ' t as popular in my country as it is here .
That ' s all right . We ' ll teach you .
Is it anything like American football ?
Not very much . It ' s something like hockey , except that you use a big ball and no stick .
I ' ll come down and watch you play some day , and see what it ' s like .
Good idea . I think you ' ll like it if you give it a chance .
There are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building .
What kinds of parades are there ?
The parades are usually military ones , but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs . What do you do on national day in your country ?
We don ' t have a national day .
Really ? That ' s unusual .
I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don ' t .
Actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . In the evening , many people watch special TV shows which celebrate national day .
Hi . It ' s Tony calling from the dentist ' s office . Is Lily there ?
No , Lily is not here at the moment .
Could you ask her to call me back when she gets in ?
Sure . What ' s your number , please .
519 367 8901 .
Thanks . And your name is Tony , right ?
Yes . I ' m Tony . Thank you very much .
You ' re welcome . Bye .
Bye .
Not yet . I don't know how to fill out the form . What is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ?
I don't really know . Why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? They will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . He can even help you avoid paying tax legally .
If I don't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ?
Certainly . No one who evades tax can escape from their detection . They ' ll check your income through computers . You'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . If you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined .
Hey Tina . What are you doing ?
I was just watching TV . What's going on with you ?
I just watched a movie and I'm scared .
What did you watch ?
I saw the Sixth Sense . I didn't know it was going to be so scary .
I remember that . It was a great movie . But it was definitely scary .
If you're not busy , do you want to come over ? I'm afraid to be alone .
Sure . I can come over . What should we do ?
How about if we watch a comedy . I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense .
Ok . I'll get ready and leave . I'll see you in about 20 minutes .
Hurry , ok . It's dark out .
Don't worry , nothings going to happen . I'll be there real soon .
Ok . See you soon .
What is that ? It looks like something from a swamp !
It's a green drink . It's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals .
You know , healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag .
The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins .
Have you ever tried it ? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ?
It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day .
It may take less time , but I don't know about easier . Yuck .
OK . I'm coming .
This is your song . I picked it for you .
Thank you . You are so considerate .
Push the red button on the mike to turn it on .
OK . This key is too high for me .
I think it's a piece of cake for you .
OK . Let me have a try ...
Well done ! I hope I can sing as well as you one day .
Thank you . I'm sure you will .
I hope so . Thank you for saying so .
I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice .
I see , may I ask what the occasion is ?
It ' s not really an occasion , it ' s more like I ' m sorry .
Very well . This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
I think I ' m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ?
Mmm , well this is our I ' m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
I don ' t think that ' s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better !
I ' m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ?
Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .
Get out of my store , you jerk !
Sorry . You know the rules .
But I want to watch TV now .
That ' s out of the question .
Please .
Not a chance .
Not even for an hour ?
Sorry , it ' s impossible .
Mike , you're late again .
I'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so I
Do you think I believe the story like that ?
But it's true .
How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ?
That's coincident .
Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time .
I promise I will .
You'd better .
I'm going to the hospital .
Get in . I'll take you .
About how much will it cost ?
It will cost you $ 10 .
By the way , what's the time ?
You can see the time on the meter . I have radio time , you know .
It's a quarter to 12 . Could you please drive a little faster ?
Certainly .
We have the offer ready for you . Let me check . 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box , at 20,000 yuan ; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box , at 30,000 yuan ; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box , at 7 , 500 yuan , for shipment in June . The offer is valid for five days .
I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected .
You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where .
I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies .
But you must take the design and quality into consideration . You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with .
I agree that yours are of the top .
Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ?
To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help .
Impossible . How about 5 % off ?
Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable .
Which tooth is it ?
This one here .
Ar , Yes . There ' s a big cavity .
Can you fill it ?
I ' m afraid not . The tooth is too far gone . it'll have to be taken out .
Then I might as well have it done now .
you ' d better wait , the gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days .
You're welcome .
No idea . Your guess is as good as mine .
It better be more than last year .
Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see .
Have you thought about the cost ?
There is that .
I believe it'll be very expensive .
yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving !
let's take a look at the menu so we can order . Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?
what would you rather have , samosas or poppadoms ?
I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .
well , let's get a plate of those then .
sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ?
I think I might have a dahl .
what's in a dahl ?
it's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .
that sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
ok . How about some lamb kebabs ?
that's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ?
I think I'll have a beer .
ok , shall I flag down the waitress ?
I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round .
you're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me !
what would you do without me ?
Yes . Do you exchange foreign money here ?
Yes . Our bank is authorized to deal with foreign exchange .
What kinds of currency do you change ?
We can change only three kinds of currency , USD , Japanese Yen and HK Dollar in our savings office .
Could you tell me what the exchange rate for USD is today ?
The buying rate is 826 . 44 yuan for 100 dollars .
I want to change some Us dollars to cover my expense here .
Please go to Counter No . 2 , the foreign exchange counter . It's over there .
Thank you .
Sorry , I just worried about him . You know , he should be here an hour ago .
Don ' t worry him , he has been grown up and I think he can take himself very well .
But he still does not come back .
Maybe he is on the way home now .
Thank you , Lisa .
Here is a present for you . I hope you like it .
Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time .
I'm very glad to hear that .
Come here , let me introduce some friends to you .
Thanks , Tim . Nice meeting you , too .
I guess we'll see just around .
Ye , I hope so . well . Take it easy .
You too .
We'd like to hear your account of the events of last night .
Better late than never .
The Grand Hotel .
The Grand Hotel ?
Yes . Do you know where it is ?
No , Madam . I don't think I do .
It's the 11th Avenue , Park Street .
Oh , yes . I know where it is .
Can I see your passbook and the withdrawal slip , please ?
Sure .
Let me just make sure . You want to withdraw one thousand dollars ?
That's right .
I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process .
And it takes up all the news .
The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up .
It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public .
Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio .
I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio .
Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line .
But I don't have any reading assignments .
Then review for your test . You'll do even better . And maybe reading will help you get to sleep .
Aw , Mom-you're such a drag .
You say that now , Lily , but you'll thank me later . I'm your mom , and mother knows best .
Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry .
What's he doing ?
He's checking bags . He ' s an official in the customs .
Of course . I've loved writing since I was a very little boy . I won the first prize in a national composition contest when I was in middle school . After attending Nanjing University , I never give up writing . My works , such as Father's Tobacco Pipe , Open Air Cinema , The old City were respectively published China Youth Daily , Yangzi Evening News , and New Beijing . During the period of studying for my degrees of master and doctor , I paid more attention to developing my research ability and published several papers . The Impact of Internet in Chinese Political Participation , The Discipline of Remold , The Historical Direction of Chinese Administration Reform , Bribery Cases of Self governance in Chinese Villages are respectively published in Chinese Publish Administration , Beijing Due Xuebao , Theory and Society and Chinese Reform . I joined in Yangzi Evening News to work as a part-time journalist in 2006 . During this period , I've written a lot of comments , which improved my writing ability to a new level , I have full confidence in my writing ability , and I believe I can do the job well .
I ' m in pretty bad shape , Doctor Ford .
Oh , In what way .
No appetite , always unaged and I can ' t sleep well .
Did you lose any weight ?
YES . I ' Ve lost quite a few pounds since last month .
when was the last time you have track up ?
About two month ago .
Let me take your blood pressure . You look anilic . Well , Mr . Brown . I ' m happy to say it ' s nothing serious . You just a little run down from overwork .
What am I suppose to do ?
I think you ' ll needs just vacation . Try to get out doors more . I ' ll be sure if you get more rest .
Thank you , doctor . I ' ll do what you say .
Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ?
Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them .
Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ?
I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves .
You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different .
Yeah , of course . You can take a taxi .
How much will that run me ?
It depends on traffic and distance , but it is reasonable .
Do the drivers speak English ?
Some are better than others . But , you shouldn't have a problem .
Are they safe ?
For the most part , yes . If you don't feel comfortable with it , then it is best not to take one at night .
With the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired .
I guess this is a good excuse to surf the Net on someone else's dime .
Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic ?
He must have just got online for the first time last week . He still thinks it's some kind of new toy .
Bob ! I hear your team won the match .
Yeah . All of us tried our best .
Congratulations !
You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo , do you ?
Well , I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true !
Of course it does ! They tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house . I think most of the times they are just scam artists .
Well , historically it is a practice that many cultures share . Reading the tarot cards , in the east they would even read tea leaves ! I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes .
All superstitious nonsense ! I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks .
Not yet . I'm not finished with my research yet .
What research ?
Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ?
But they're just ads .
Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends .
Yes , it's been marvelous . It really was very kind of you to invite me . I hope it hasn't been too much trouble .
Not at all . We've really enjoyed having you . I hope you'll come and stay again next time you're in Changsha .
All right .
Here is your ticket .
Thank you .
The park will close soon . We Should better go in right now .
Really ?
Yes , let's go in .
It is a new park , isn't it ?
Yes , how do you know ?
I guessed it .
Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well .
Oh , how wonderful !
No problem at all . Could I have your full name , please ?
Sure , John Sandals .
Hi , Mr . Sandals . I'm Michelle , at your service . When do you need the room ?
My plans are to be there April 14th to the 17th .
We have new room rates , sir . Will that be acceptable to you ?
Well , it depends on the price , of course . What is it ?
It's $ 308 a night .
I have no problem with that .
Great ! Would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking ?
Definitely nonsmoking . I can't handle that smell .
Nonsmoking . Now , is a queen-size bed okay ?
No problem .
Great , Mr . Sandals . Your reservation is confirmed . Now all I need is your phone number .
Of course ! It's area code 626-555-1739 .
Thank you so much , Mr . Sandals . We look forward to seeing you !
Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .
Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .
He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him .
Me too .
Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .
Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?
Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited .
He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .
And the host announced that he won it all !
Yes . Thank you .
Would you care for a drink before you order ?
A glass of Qingdao beer .
Yes , sir . I'll bring it over . Have you decided what you'd like , sir ?
Will you make some recommendation ?
My name is Liu Lichi . How do you do ?
How do you do ? Please be seated , How is your trip here ?
Quite good , I think . I came here by bus , and it took me about 15 minutes .
Oh , yes . How old are you ?
Twenty .
Hum , still a student ?
Yes , I'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics .
What subjects are you studying ?
English , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy .
Have you had any working experience .
Well , I worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays .
What do you like to do in your spare time ?
I like sports very much . Besides that , I also like working on a computer in my spare time .
How are your English and computer skills ?
I have passed the CET - 4 and 6 . As far as computer is concerned I can use the computer for word processing .
Okay . Mr . Liu , we'll inform you of the results within a week .
You know , I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it .
The style of the exterior is just what I ' Ve been looking for !
The exterior is only half of the story . The interior is incredible .
This home is gorgeous on the inside !
Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new .
The wall colors totally suit the style of this house .
Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen .
I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops .
The master suite is the best . Let ' s go look at that next .
There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room .
I know that you like this house , but let ' s take a look at the others before you make up your mind .
Over there .
What fun ! Normally I ' d love to , but I ' m afraid I have to work late tonight . We ' Ve got to get the contract ready for Miss King .
Oh , right . You ' re busy with that contract . Maybe you could join us later ?
Unfortunately , I just can ' t make it this time . I have to go straight home . It ' s my second wedding anniversary , and we ' re supposed to be having a big dinner Susan would kill me if I missed it .
Happy anniversary ! Sorry you won ' t be there . Maybe some other time ?
Yeah , maybe . Thanks , anyway . Hope you guys have a great time !
I will take a rain check .
I am Chinese by birth .
Where is your domicile place ?
My domicile place is Hebes Province .
Can you take he away from me ?
I ' m just coming for that .
She kept bothering me .
She ' s your sister . What she asked was only duck soup for you . Why can ' t you be good to her ?
But I am her brother , not her servant .
That's easy . It was your office ergonomics that decided me .
You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ?
Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t
Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ?
Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff .
Well , welcome to the team .
He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
It ' s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know .
You have much patience .
Wow ! Your calligraphy is very beautiful . It was worth the wait !
Thank you . Today I'm writing a kind of poem called a Chinese couplet .
What does it say ?
This is an especially famous one . It says " May the passing days bring you health and longevity . May this season of renewal find you basked in riches . "
That's very nice . Is it for sale ?
No . I never sell my artwork .
Really ? Then what do you do with it ?
I give it away . Here , this one is for you .
Wow ! Really ? Are you sure ? Now I'll have a lucky year !
Remember , real luck must be created ( by ) yourself , and then it cannot be given or taken away ...
Three bags and a suitcase . This is my luggage to check .
Do you have any carry-on luggage ?
No .
Put your luggage on the scale , please . Oh , your luggage is overweight .
How much is the excess baggage part charge ?
Twenty-two dollars
Here you are .
This is your voucher , and you can get your luggage back on this . Have a good trip !
Thank you !
Yeah , I'm afraid so .
If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude .
Yes , it is annoying .
Well , I love it . The room is spacious and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place !
That ' s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
What was so bad about it ?
Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ' t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
Yes , I am afraid there are not enough outlets .
Well , we have 6 for each room .
Yes , but 4 of them are broken . Can you send someone here ?
OK sir , please wait a minute .
hey , Isabelle ...
Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .
yes , I am the guy ...
what a bummer ! You set me up ?
let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ...
Hello , I am going to the store to buy some fruit .
Oh , Would you do me a favor ?
Yes ?
Please mail this letter for me on your way to the store .
Sure . Do you want it to be registered ?
Yes , I think so . There are some pictures in it . It would be a great pity if they were lost .
Yes , I will be glad to mail your letter .
Thanks .
you are welcome .
Yes . Actually our range of sweaters is the most comprehensive available .
Can I try this one on ?
Sure , go ahead .
The color is too bright . For my age , I would prefer a lighter color .
It's ten after six . We ' re late . But dinner is at six thirty .
I know . I know . I'm really sorry . I lost my bag .
I'll call the lost and found office .
I didn't think of it . Thank you . And I do apologize for being late .
The apples are 30NT each . How many would you like ?
Let's see , 30NT is about ... almost a dollar US . What ? ! How about these pineapples ?
They're 250NT each , but they're not edible . They're only used for worship .
Hmm , 250NT is ... 8 dollars ? ! ! And you can't even eat them ? You're crazy !
Wait ! Don't go just yet . These bananas are pretty cheap--only 35NT for this bunch .
Now that's more like it ! Bananas have lots of potassium , too !
They're also good for your digestion ! Would you like some kiwis , too ?
Are they from Taiwan ?
They're imported from New Zealand . Four for 50NT . Nine for a hundred .
OK . I'll take four kiwis .
Well I think I can afford that apartment . But are pets allowed ?
Hmm ... let me look . Yes , it says it's a pet-friendly building .
That's great . That means I can bring my cat , Mr . Twinkles . Where is the apartment located ?
It says it's located in the suburbs .
No , this isn't .
Could you please get him on the phone ?
Sure . Wait a minute .
That ' s certainly true . But , that ' s what this job is all about , Maria . There's no doubt that this project is unacceptable .
I agree . But I think that we can handle the problem by making a few major changes . I ' d appreciate it if you would give me a chance .
All right , Maria . I ' ll give you until tomorrow at 4:00 to produce a satisfactory piece of work , but otherwise , you ' ll have to re-do it .
I want to American breakfast with fried eggs sunny side up .
What kind of juice do you prefer , sir ?
Breakfast juice and please make my coffee very strong .
Yes , sir . American breakfast with fried eggs sunny side up . Breakfast juice and black coffee . And my correct , sir ?
Yes , that ' s right .
Is there anything else , sir ?
No , that ' s all .
Good morning , sir . I ' Ve got breakfast your ordered .
Just put it on the table please .
Do you need anything else , sir ?
No , thanks . Oh , yes , could I have some juice for the mini bar ?
What kind of juice do you like sir ?
Tomato or orange juice , please .
Yes , sir . I ' ll get them for you right away . Would you please sign this bill first ? Thank you , sir .
Easter's a good day for reunions . The family goes to church together .
And after church they come here for lunch ?
Yup , a big potluck buffet . And then-notice there are no children around ?
Yeah , what's up with that ?
The kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . Hide away , Yi-jun !
About 50 miles .
The traffic is not very heavy on this high way , is it ? So I ' m sure we ' ll make it .
No , but we ' Ve got a hurry . It will be the rush hour soon .
Don ' t worry . There ' s plenty of time yet .
But it ' s Friday today . This road is always jam packed during the weekend , isn ' t it ?
Right .
I have a sore throat and headache .
Do you feel tired ?
Yes , my whole body feels weak . And I really feel terrible .
I'm sorry to hear that . I'll have to examine you .
Ok , go ahead .
Open your mouth and show me your tongue . Say ah ... You have a bad cold . So you must stay in bed for a week .
Yes , I can , but not very well .
Where did you learn it ?
At school . And I'm still learning it now .
How long have you been learning it ?
About three years .
Can you speak any other languages ?
I'm afraid not .
May I ask you something ?
What's your question ?
How many hours behind the wheel do I need ?
What do you need to take it for ?
I'm trying to get my license .
You need six hours .
Can I do all six hours in one day ?
You have to do it in three days .
That's all I have to do ?
That's everything .
Well , that's a relief .
Hello , Becky . Well , you see , I have this thing here , called a Fixed Deposit Certificate , and I've just noticed the date on it .
Oh , I see . You have two choices here you can either redeem or renew .
I think I'll redeem , if that's not a problem .
No problem at all , Mr Waterstone . Any preference as to how you want the money ?
Anything you like , but not too many large notes . It's useful to have smaller notes .
Here we go , Mr Waterstone . Here's your money and your interest note .
Yes , yes . Everything's fine . Thank you very much , Becky .
Do you have this shirt in a small ?
Let me check . Yes , we have .
May I try it on ?
Sure . Let me help you .
Hello , I ' m Mark . I ' m just wondering if you are free this weekend
Yes , I think So .
Good . I was thinking that I ' d like to invite you to watch a movie . I can meet you at the cinema gate .
What ' s the time ?
Six thirty , tonight .
Oh , I ' m sorry I can ' t because I have to do some housework . You can ask Jenny to go with you
All right . Maybe next time I can go with you . Bye !
Good bye !
He must be green . It ' s lucky that we will get off soon .
You see ? Every cloud has a silver lining .
Hello . I need to find out if a Receipt of Proceeds has arrived . I'm from Felix Wasserman Associates .
Thanks . Have you got the L / C number ?
It's NX567822100007 .
Hang on a tick and I'll check for you . I'm sorry ; we have no record of that arriving .
OK , thanks for checking . Could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ?
No problem . I'll be in touch as soon as it comes in .
Yes , it's $ 167 .
Thank you .
Yes , G stands for General Audiences , PG means Parental Guidance suggested , R is restricted to audiences under 18 and X means explicit content .
Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ?
Remember when we were kids ? Theaters wouldn't let kids in to PG moves without a parent .
I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed .
Now with video rentals it's all a personal matter .
Yea , I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either .
Now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't .
Yes , I do , Susan . Just a moment . Here it is .
Thank you , sir . Sorry to trouble you .
Not at all , Susan . Just tell him to leave it with my secretary when he ' s finished with it
What is your favorite color , miss ?
Red .
Here you are . It ' s very attractive .
May I try it on ?
Go ahead .
Is there a mirror around here ?
Right over there .
Does it suit me ?
Yes , you look very nice .
How much is it ?
We're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax .
That's quite reasonable .
He's 21 . How old is James ?
He's a year older than Keith , but he looks younger .
How's your father ?
He's fine . He retired last week . It's a turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .
He can spend more time with his grandchildren .
Oh , I don't think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea !
How do you want to spend your old age ?
In the same way , probably .
Played poker with my work friends .
Did you win ?
Of course .
Yes , certainly . How can I recognize him ?
He is short , well-built , and he ' s got light blond hair .
Is there anything else ?
He has a mustache , if I remember correctly , and a light complexion .
How old is he ?
He is in his late thirties .
Well . I shouldn ' t have any trouble recognizing him . What time does his flight arrive ?
At 2 thirty .
I would like to use a computer .
Do you have your library card ?
I sure do .
There is a wait for the computers .
That ' s all right .
You need to print your name on this list .
Okay . Now what ?
Once a computer is available , I will let you know .
How am I supposed to log on to the computer ?
All you do is type in the number on the back of your card .
That ' s it ? Thank you very much .
I am afraid not . Are there any vacant tables ?
I don't think so . You have to wait for about 10 minutes .
That's all right .
Great , thanks .
Can I help you ?
I would actually like to view the apartment for rent today .
I ' m sorry , but you won ' t be able to view it today .
Why not ?
You have to make an appointment first .
Oh , okay . Can I do that right now ?
Is this Friday okay ?
Is 6 o ' clock Friday evening okay ?
Yes , I will schedule you for that time .
Thank you very much . See you then .
Could I get a hamburger , please ?
Would you like cheese on that ?
No , thank you .
Would you like a drink ?
Let me have a soda .
What kind of soda would you like ?
May I have a Sprite , please ?
Sure , no problem .
I would also like a bag of chips .
Will that be all ?
That's everything .
I ' m doing well .
How may I help you ?
Could you cancel a check for me ?
What ' s the problem ?
I wrote the check out for way too much .
How much ?
I wrote the check out for $ 150 .
What were you supposed to write it out for ?
I was supposed to write the check out for $ 100 .
I ' ll just cancel it for you right now .
That ' s great . You ' re a lifesaver .
Yes . I ' m going to travel around Europe .
Wow , that sounds great ! Where are you going ?
I think I will start off in Paris . Then I ' m going to take the train to Nice and then go on to Milan .
Oh that will be lovely . You ' ll be able to do lots of shopping I expect .
Oh yes and try lots of new food too .
Great . Make sure you buy me a souvenir !
Oh , don ' t worry , I will !
What do you mean ?
It looks like the shipping company did this .
We'd better take it up with them , in that case .
Tell me what seems to be the problem .
My roommate always brings a lot of friends from off-campus . They stay in the room until midnight , singing and talking , drinking and playing cards while I have no place for study . I even don't have the quietness to sleep .
Did you ever talk to him about it ?
Yes , thank you . I've already been helping myself .
This dish taste terrific . Would you like to try a little ? It is a little hot , but very good .
I like hot food , especially Sichuan cuisine .
Would you like another beer ?
I'll have another cup of beer insist . I know I don't like to drink alone , especially there are someone sitting there next to me .
Come on , it's the weekend . Let's taste and enjoy this meal . Cheers !
Bottom's up , and you're right . This meal is incredible . I wish I had known this restaurant before . Thanks for bringing me here . I know I'll be back agile soon .
I'm not sure , I feel hot and cold .
When did the trouble start ?
I was sick most of the night .
It sounds like you are coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature .
Have I got a high fever ?
Yes , thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ?
Yes , I have .
Now , let me have a look at you . I'd like to listen to your chest . Now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it Cough , now again . I want to examine your throat , too . Open wide , say ' Ah - - '
Aaaaahh , aaaaahh .
Yes , it does look a bit sore . Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests .
All right , thanks .
The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection .
What shall I do today ?
I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . Take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . Drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . Here's the prescription .
I'm looking for some earrings for my wife as a wedding anniversary gift .
You've come to the right store . We've got a beautiful and wide selection of earrings for you to choose from .
I saw a pair of earrings outside your window . Can you show them to me ?
Do you mean the exquisite pearl earrings ?
Exactly . How much do you want for them ?
They're only three thousand yuan .
What is this setting made of ?
Well , it's specially made of a platinum alloy , sir , and the lustre will never fade out .
I'II take them . Please wrap them up tor me and give me the receipt .
You've made an excellent choice , sir .
He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ?
I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles .
I can think of better things to dream about ...
Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away .
That's crazy .
For almost two years .
Almost two years ? Your English is very good .
Thank you . But there's still a lot for me to learn .
of course I'd come . I couldn't think of a better chance to see all my old friends .
yeah . It's hard to believe that it's been ten years since graduation . It feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas .
how time flies . But hey , how are things going with you ?
oh , where to start ? There have been ups and downs . I'm still trying to find my place in this world . It's only recently that I've been able to start settling down . How about you ? You still with Jenn
yeah , Jenny and I got married right after graduation . It was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . I was supporting us both while she continued her studies . But now things are getting better
oh , that sounds wonderful . I have always known you two would make it . I hope I can keep in better contact with you guys . I don't want us to drift apart again .
definitely ! Actually , we just moved into a new place . There's a house-warming party this Saturday , if you are free ? I know Jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party .
sounds great ! I'll be there .
Good morning , Ruth . Did I wake you up ?
No , I was just about to get up . What's up , Carl ?
Listen , I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus ?
B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown .
Oh , you mean Canal Street ?
That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown .
Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ?
At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ?
I cannot get hold of her yet .
See you around , Carl .
See you later .
God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ?
Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day .
They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest .
I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project .
You'd better pay more attention to your health .
I will , thanks for your concern .
You're welcome .
Hello , everybody . I am Monica and this is my first day at work . I am working in the finance department . I am very happy to meet everyone and I am looking forward to working well with all of you . I am very happy to be one of the team and I will do my best to get into the working situation as soon as possible . By the way , call me Monica . Everybody calls me so .
You do ? How are you going to contact him ?
I'm leaving him a message taped to my computer screen .
What does it say ? Do you think he'll see it ?
He'll see it . It says , I like sweets . Meet me at two thirty in the parking lot .
Can I spy on you guys from the window ?
No . But I'll fill you in later . Right now I have to find Vince .
En ... it tastes good . I appreciate what you have done for me .
let me give you a little advice . You know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance .
I often do , but I ' m worried about the responses from other people .
you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion .
I ' m worried that what I say will not make sense .
we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking .
that ' s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ?
that ' s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle .
I didn ' t realize that speaking in class could be so easy .
the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ' t be sure how .
I'm very sorry , sir . I could put you on a waiting list , but you would be wise to check out other means of travel .
You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ?
I have not sir . But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here .
Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well .
Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list .
How many people are on the waiting list right now ?
Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list . And you are number 176 .
It'll take us all some time to get used to the change .
Good afternoon ! Sit down , please . How are you ?
I'm very well , thank you . How are you ?
Very well too , thank you very much . Isn ' t it a lovely day ?
Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot .
Yes .
What's the weather like in your country ?
Mm ... It's quite warm now .
Where do you live ?
In London . Where do you live ?
Here . Near this school .
Good . I don't want to leave Beijing without visiting it .
How far is it from our hotel ?
It's about 5 kilometers .
If we start early , do we have some time for Yuanmingyuan ?
I think so . We can go there in the afternoon if you like .
Sure . Just leave it to me . I'll finish it .
You do ?
Yeah , those classics from the great writers .
But I find Japanese ones better .
Would you like those with yogurt ?
Sure , why not ?
What else would you like to add ? We highly recommend caterpillar fungus .
Caterpillar fungus ? ! What the heck is that ?
It ' s a special kind of Chinese herb . It ' s good for you !
Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth !
I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better .
Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards .
It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case .
But I'm not sleepy , Mum . Can I stay and watch more TV ?
It's already half past eleven . You have school tomorrow . You'll sleepy all tomorrow , if you don't sleep well tonight .
I know . But I promise I won't be sleepy tomorrow . I work really hard .
Don't you have the exams coming up soon ? I'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those .
Oh , I nearly forgot the exams .
You do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . Am I right ?
Yeah , I guess so . Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow .
An excellent idea . Work now and play later .
I know you're right . School is more important than TV . Can I watch one more show , then go to bed .
No , now it's bedtime .
Yes , can I help you ?
Well , this is my baggage claim tag . Can you get my baggage now ?
OK , here you are .
Thanks a lot .
It's nothing serious . But I always have a headache , and I haven't slept properly for several weeks . I've also lost appetite and my eyes are burning .
Mm , you do look rather pale . Let me take your temperature . Would you put the thermometer under your arm , please ? Now , let me listen to your pulse . Mm , do you feel weak ?
Yes , I never seem to have any energy .
I'll give you a blood test . Would you roll up your sleeve ? Just as I thought . You're anemic . You'd better pay more attention to your diet . Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . And don't stay up late working . Try to get more rest .
Thank you .
How can I ever thank you ? I owe you a big favor .
Hello . I would like to speak to your director of human resources , Ms . Jenkins , Please .
Just a moment . I'll check to see if she is at her desk . May I tell her who is calling ?
This is Bill Burton from Milford Insurance , I'm calling in regards to our meeting next Tuesday .
Thank you , Mr . Burton . Can you please hold for a moment ? I'll check to see if she is available .
No problem .
I'm sorry , Ms . Jenkins is away from her desk . She has already left for lunch . Would you like to leave a message for her ?
That's excellent . How have you managed that ?
Mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system .
What does that mean exactly ?
Well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers .
What other sources of energy do you use ?
We don't use any fossil fuels . Most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants . We're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power .
Of course ! Are you ?
I plan to , but what day is the election ?
You should know that .
Can you just tell me ?
The election is this Tuesday .
Are you serious ?
I ' m not kidding .
It ' s a good thing I asked you .
That should ' Ve been something you knew already .
I couldn ' t remember .
Whatever . Just make sure you go vote .
I can hardly make ends meet these days .
same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months .
my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .
true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .
definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .
the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken .
is that inflation ?
inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation .
has the government taken some measures to curb it ?
yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .
but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .
you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .
how ?
for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense .
sounds a good idea .
Zina , why are you whispering ?
I've been talking to WebTracker . I'm thinking of jumping ship .
What ? Are you serious ? You'd defect to our archrival ! ?
Keep your voice down . We'll talk more later . Right now I need to see Vince .
We definitely have to talk , Zina . And watch your back . Elvin is still mad about his nose .
OK , but don't tell anyone what I said .
Yes , what kind of room do you want ?
I prefer one facing the sea . Besides , it should have a shower .
Sorry , right now we can only have you a room without shower .
Well , that's fine .
I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that !
Well you can ' t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I ' m the banker .
Banker ?
Yes ...
Can I have my $ 200 please ?
Sure . Here you are , $ 200 , Thank you , please come again ! Now it ' s my turn to roll the dice .
Nice to see you again , too . Peter . How's your family ?
A :: Very well . How's Mrs Clinton ?
Not bad , But she's as busy as before .
Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night . I got to know the fact that you are playing the field .
Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth .
I majored in international banking at college so I took many insurance courses . And I worked at an insurance company for my graduation field work .
Why do you want to be an insurance agent ?
I care about people and I know the importance of insurance .
Do you have any work experience in promotion ?
Yes , I do . I have worked as a salesman for P & G Company Ltd .
Do people respond well to you ?
Yes , I'm good with people .
Well , I ' ll be glad to help you out . I can come out anytime on Tuesday or Thursday of next week .
Let ' s put it down for 1:15 on Thursday . We ' ll definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .
Fine . I ' ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on Thursday .
Yes , the nearest one is at the third cross of this road .
I'm a stranger here . How can I get there , please ?
Just walk down the road for a few minutes , and you'll find it on your right .
Thank you very much .
I'm going to quit the job .
Why ?
The task is tough .
You'd look before you leap .
Thanks for your concern .
Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it .
Totally agree . What is your solution ?
Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy .
You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
But I don ' t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .
I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
Could you show me where the Chinesc-style clothing is located ? I want to buy a silk coat .
This way , please . Here they are . They're all handmade .
Oh , they look nice . May I try that black one on ?
Of course . The fitting room is right over there .
Do you have a medium in the same color ? This one is a little tight .
l'm sorry . All the black of that size are sold out . Would you like a red one ?
OK . Let me try it on . What do you think ?
Oh , that suits you very well . Besides it is believed in China that the red color brings happiness and good luck .
Really ? I'II take it and I'm leaving here tomorrow . Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you get it in ?
Our pleasure . Please fill out this form , leaving your address and telephone number .
Thanks . How much would that come to ?
Let me see ...
Yes , I have booked a room for 24th . It's a double room .
Hold on , please . Let me check it for you . Yes , you're right . You will keep it for 3 days .
Well , now I want to change the date from 24th to 28th .
OK , that shall be arranged .
Oh , that's all right .
I must apologize . I'll buy you a new one tomorrow .
No , please don't . I couldn't let you do that .
Tell me what the problem is .
I can't figure out how to turn them on .
Do you have some quarters ?
I didn't know I needed change .
The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar .
Where do I put the change ?
The quarters go into the slot . You have to push the slot in , and the machine will turn on .
Is that everything that I have to do ?
That's all there is .
I appreciate you helping me with this .
If you need anything else , just let me know .
This is Mr . White speaking .
Hi . I understand that you have a house for sale , haven ' t you ?
Yes .
I ' d like to know more about it .
Can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o ' clock ?
OK . I will be there .
Thank you for calling . Goodbye .
Bye .
Yes . I want to buy a pair of shoes .
Have you a pattern in your mind ?
Well , maybe sneakers or rubber shoes .
Is there any special brand you would like ?
Could I have look at that pair of canvas shoes ? They look nice .
Why ?
Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too .
I don't know . I just need to try it once . I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight .
You should try swimming then . It helps you to keep fit .
Fine , thank you . I haven ' t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ?
I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films .
Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary .
Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them .
It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one .
But it's really exciting .
Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one .
Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror .
Yep .
I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind .
Maybe . After all , I am grown up now .
But Saturday is my birthday .
I think it ' s important to do now . We can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital .
But it won ' t be on my birthday .
But your health is more important . Believe me !
Bargain ? I'd feel way too guilty .
But you could have saved money .
From a sweet ma ? ! It's not worth it . Plus , I'd happily pay more for these things I bought !
F . Y . I . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you're done ...
Ha ! I'm just warming up ! Please take me there now !
Just tor three days . I won't need these luggages . CouId I put them here ?
I am sorry . If you have here more than 24 hours between connecting flights , we can't check your luggage through London .
Well , maybe I can put them in the airport storage there .
That's right . It's over there .
I'd like to buy some milk powder . What would you recommend ?
We have many kinds of different purpose . I wonder whom you are buying for ?
My son . He is two years old .
I see , sir . This one is very good .
Is it ?
You may rest assured . It sells well .
May I have a look at the introduction ?
Certainly . Here it is .
You are speaking with Professor Clark .
Professor , I am Kalina from your morning literature class .
Yes , how can I help you ?
I ran my car into a tree yesterday and need to miss a few days of school .
Oh , my God ! I hope you are all right .
I have a concussion , but I will be OK .
How much school will you miss ?
I only need to take this week off .
I appreciate you calling and telling me that you won ' t be in class . See you next week !
What's the criteria for staff to attend ? Are we only including our management team in this affair ? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ?
Lower level employees need not attend . The purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level . In order to get everyone to jell together , we've got to include some fun . That's the reason for the retreat .
How do you know that ?
She told me that Peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage .
Oh , I see . But I think you are making a fuss . They will make it up . Bet it .
Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot .
I hear that John's leading a double wife .
It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife .
If that happen to me , I ' ll take them back to the shop .
I did . But they said they won ' t change them .
That ' s terrible . But if they wouldn ' t change them , I know what I would do .
yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ?
great , let's go !
hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world .
exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ...
yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies !
why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .
are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ?
never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ?
yeah , I think so .
ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great .
wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases .
Do we have to ?
Come on , it ' s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging .
It ' s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . It gives the room a good atmosphere .
A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart , and it ' s messing up the room .
But it makes the place feel so much like Christmas . I ' d really hate to have to take it down .
But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ' s been there only because we ' Ve been too busy to get rid of it .
I know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away .
But it ' s falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches .
I know , I know . But it reminds me of the great Christmas we just had . All of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted .
Yeah , it was a good Christmas . It won ' t always be this good , but we can ' t make it last longer than it should .
Ok , fine . We need to take down the tree .
I ' ll make a deal with you . We ' ll leave it up until Sunday , and then we ' ll take it down after church .
Let's see , sir . According to your file , you watched ' Titanic ' Monday evening .
Well , the wrong information is in my file . I was at a concert Monday night .
Well , your word overrules the file , sir . One moment , please .
I knew you'd see it my way .
Sir , I deleted the $ 10 , but I had to add a $ 2 service charge to your bill .
Am I in the Twilight Zone ? You're charging me for a movie I never saw ?
Please don't blame me , sir . Blame the computer programmer .
This is highway robbery . I've got a good mind to call the police !
If it makes you feel any better , other guests feel the same way .
I'm ready now . I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn .
And would you like an appetizer before your meal ? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup .
I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad .
Can I get you anything to drink ? :
Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea .
Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
Thank you .
I am terribly sorry . You didn't come to reconfirm recently . You should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled .
But I have been so busy all these days . Well , is there any other ticket available ? I want the next one .
Yes . I feel refreshed .
How long will we dock ?
In half an hour . The surface of the lake is calm .
Yes . We come at the right time .
What do I do with it ?
Do you want me to help you ?
Please .
Look . Here are the core classes . Everyone has to take them .
So I don't have to worry about them .
You're catching on ! However , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ...
I'll take home economics .
Good . Now you can pick classes by yourself .
Hello , John .
I'm with Hartford public relations . I'd like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services .
How about tomorrow at 11 o'clock ?
Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall .
What's the problem ?
She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she ' s around .
For example ?
Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .
No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .
My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .
Sure . What do you need the most help with , the food or entertainment ?
I need help with food .
OK , well , let's coordinate our efforts . Should this party be formal or casual ?
I think it should be casual .
I agree . Next , we have to decide on food . We have a choice of Chinese or Continental Cuisine . Which one should we have ?
I would prefer Chinese food for this party .
Perfect choice . For music , should we have a live band or a DJ ?
I think we should hire a live band .
OK then . Well , I will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on Friday .
Thank you . I ' m pleased to meet you , Mr . Brown . My name is Kathy Pewless , the representative of Green Textile Import and Export Corporation .
Pleased to meet you too , Ms . Pewless . I travel a lot every year on business , but this is my first visit to your country . I must say I have been much impressed by your friendly people .
Thank you for saying so . Have you seen the exhibition halls ? On display are most of our products , such as silk , woolen knitwear , cotton piece goods , and garments .
Oh , yes . I had a look yesterday . I found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I ' Ve gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I ' Ve got some idea of your exports . I ' m interested in your silk blouses .
Our silk is known for its good quality . It is one of our trade - trional exports . Silk blouses are brightly colored and beau - fully designed . They ' Ve met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand .
I didn't really like it .
Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
I found it very disappointing .
She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see .
I wasn't happy with it .
Nothing is to your satisfaction .
He can barely make ends meet .
Not a problem . What time shall we call you ?
I always hit the snooze button , so give me two calls , one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen .
It'll be our pleasure . We'll call you at 7 and then at 7 fifteen .
Oops , cancel that . Change the second call to 7 thirty will you , please ?
No sooner said than done . Can I help you with anything else ?
No , that's about it for now . Thanks .
Okay , sir . Have a pleasant evening .
no , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend .
yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go .
they must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood .
they're also one of the richest couples . They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want .
I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars .
did either one of them win an Oscar this year ?
I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything .
Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?
yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous .
I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .
people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated .
I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .
that's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go .
thank goodness we're not rich and famous !
being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich .
Yeah , about .
Do you know Chinese better now ?
Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone .
Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere .
I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation .
A shouting match ? You ' re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ' t believe it .
I am not exaggerating at all . I ' m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time .
Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ' t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ' s quite natural to us .
Yes , absolutely true .
Yes , speaking .
I want to know whether you will come to the interview . So have you accepted offers from other companies ?
No , I haven't got one by now . I will go to the interview of yours .
Yes , I used to have a part-time job in advertising company .
What were you mean duties there ?
I mostly did advertising planning .
What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ?
I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market .
What was the most important thing you have learned at work ?
The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success . If I want to make in marking in advertising industry , I can ' t stop studying and creating .
Anne ! I haven't seen you for ages . How ' Ve you been ?
Fine , just fine . And you ?
Not bad . It really is great to see you again . Where have you been ?
Guangzhou . I've got a cousin there .
I think it's the postman . Will you go and open the door ?
All right . I'll get it .
All set . I've got my makeup , my Cds , and my portable TV set ...
Hello ! We're supposed to be getting back to nature .
Yeah , yeah . Anyway ... I'm packed . Are you ?
I've been packed for a week . All my stuff is in this backpack .
Let me see ... two books ... birdseed ?
That's trail mix !
Same difference . What's this ?
Hold on a minute , please .
Thank you .
I am sorry to have kept you waiting . Mr . Johns needs a telephone call from you .
Would you bring the message to my room .
I'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment .
Then I'll come down and pick up the message immediately .
OK , we wait for you .
What would you like ?
Twenties and some smaller bills , please .
Anything else ?
Yes . Could you tell many balance ? Here's account number .
Quite often . It is very convenient , saving me a lot of time .
Do you have some experiences to share with me ? I want to have a try .
You are asking the right person . Here are two very important tips . First , you need to visit no more than one site to find the best products and prices . I can recommend you some online merchants . Second , write your mail address correctly . Otherwise , you can ' t receive your delivery in time .
What about the registration procedure ? Is that complicated ?
Not at all . You just need to provide your name , address , e-mail address , phone number and bank or credit card information . I will help you with that .
It is so nice of you .
I ' m fine . Thank you .
Do you need anything ?
I need you to help me .
What can I do for you ?
I am looking for an article in a newspaper .
Did you check the periodicals ?
I didn ' t even bother to think of that .
I ' ll show you where to find your article .
I get lost in this library .
It ' s right this way .
Thanks a lot for your help .
That's great . What's on tonight ?
I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one .
Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better .
Don't you think it's too bloody ?
On the contrary , very exciting .
And ?
And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
Poor child !
Gave me the receipt , please .
Here is my receipt .
What's wrong with it ?
It's too small for me to wear .
Would you like another bigger one ?
No thanks . I want to have a refund .
OK , here is your money .
We should have it put together by the end of next week .
Great ! That ' ll be ahead of schedule ! Good work .
Well , as the saying goes -- we aim to please !
We'd better go out for a walk .
Which season do you like best ?
Spring .
How about summer ?
I dislike it most .
Why ?
Because the hottest season is summer in a year .
But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
I haven't played chess for a long time .
That's all right , I'm a beginner . I've just learnt how to play .
Look , there's a chessboard . Those two men have already finished playing .
You're a very good player
Not really , but once I won a prize .
So did I . I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners .
My prize was for the best player in the country . Now let's start playing chess seriously .
and what if it doesn't work out , right ?
Exactly .
You need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . You know how I know ?
How ?
Because I won't let it fail .
But what about tomorrow ? What if Stars . com decides to go with WebTracker , and not us ?
I don ' t think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking .
Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes will do no good .
No , you can ' t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres .
Give me a Big Mac , a small order of French fries and a medium Coke .
You'll need to wait a few minutes for the fries . They are still in the fryer .
That's fine .
Your total comes to $ 7 .
Here's a twenty . Could you give me some more napkins ?
Sure . Your cash back is $ 13 . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes .
Thanks .
Well , I am a bit out of shape . I'm thinking about getting some exercises to keep fit .
Oh , that's good news for us .
So what do you provide ?
First of all , we'll design a custom-made work-out plan according to your habits .
How can you get that done ?
Well , we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified . And he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan for your needs .
What else ?
Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal .
Sounds pretty good . What about the charge ?
That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year .
Maybe one month . Just have a try first . Not too tough at the beginning .
Wise decision . You'll find it's totally worth it .
Please , where do I catch the plane for New York ?
First you must check in at Counter No . 4 .
That one there ?
That's right . Then you will follow the signs to Gate 85 .
Thank you . You ' Ve been very helpful .
Yes , of course . There are many steps . You can apply for the job on the Internet and then send your resume to the e-mail address of the company . And wail the feedback of the company .
What is the qualification needed by the position ?
You must have over 2 years'experience first .
Things are going good today . How have you been doing , Mary ?
Things are going well for me , Joe .
Want to go see a movie tonight ?
My parents are taking me to dinner tonight .
Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ?
What movie did you want to see ?
There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer .
I was thinking that I would like to see " The Secret Life of Bees . "
Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to !
Wow ! It's a fruit sculpture ! Your chef is a real artist !
Actually , uh , I made it myself ...
You did ? Wow ! Where did you learn ...
Sorry , but I've gotta run . Enjoy your food , and ring the service button if you need anything else !
I like board games . I like chinese chess and draughts .
I ' Ve never played Chinese chess before , but I ' Ve seen old men playing it in the street . It looks complicated .
It ' s about as complicated as chess . The basic rule and moves are simple enough , but there are many strategies that players need to learn .
I like playing cards . I ' m pretty good at poker . Do you play cards ?
I ' m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling , like poker . If I did , I ' d lose all my money .
Do you play bridge ?
Yes , I do . It ' s hard to find four players though , so I don ' t play very often . Do you know anyone who plays ? If so , we could set up a game .
I can play quite well . I have a friend who likes playing , but she ' s not very good at it . Shall I invite her to play ?
Sure , I have a friend who play fairly well . We should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game .
I ' ll call my friend now . you call yours .
I'm sorry I'm late . I overslept . Is the manager here today ?
Yes he ' s in his office .
Oh , I hope he didn't notice me .
Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you .
You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ?
I think he might . You'd better go to his office .
You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic .
Good luck !
Doctor , I have a bad cough and a headache .
Do you have a fever ?
I don't know , but I feel terrible .
Let me examine you . Don't worry . It's nothing serious .
Do you think I should lie in bed ?
Yes , stay in bed and drink a lot of water . Your fever will be gone in a day or two .
OK . Do you think I can play football tomorrow ?
Of course not . You need a good rest .
OK , I'll listen to you .
What's Tiananmen famous for ?
It is largest pop square in the world . you see that is monument for the people's hero , and the Chairman Mao memorial hall on the south . there is great hall of the people on the west . there are two museums on the east .
What's that ?
That's the Forbidden city on the north of Gate building .
All the sightseeing in china is very attractive and crescive . travelling to China is very worth one . thank you so much for your guides , and I'll miss you .
Search me .
Have you decided what wine you would like ?
I have no idea . Maybe you can give me some advice .
I recommend you the white wine . It will wake up your appetite .
That's great , bring me a bottle of that please .
Why , do we need groceries ?
I believe we are all out of food .
Do you know what to get ?
I don't know what we need .
Why don't you go and check the refrigerator ?
I would appreciate it if you would do that for me .
Why don't you just get the basics ?
What do you mean ?
Eggs , milk , bread . Things like that .
Go make that list .
Sure , no problem .
My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office . I didn't know you were working here . What a surprise . How long have you been doing this ?
Two years or so .
That is great . Do you have to work the night shift ?
No , in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . I work five days a week .
Do you enjoy work here ?
It is hard to say . But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant . Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy .
Take it easy . I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job .
Luckily not . The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss .
Glad to hear that .
I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ?
My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L . A . Hank and I will be flying there tonight .
I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ?
Doctors aren't sure yet . But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .
You need a babysitter .
Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight . Maybe even for two nights .
I could have Suzy stay at my place .
I don't want to do that to you , Karen .
Why not ?
Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .
I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston . She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .
I'd like to talk with her . This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .
I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .
I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it . But I'd rather have someone a little older .
I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .
Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .
Take it easy . you ' Ve made enough preparations .
I'm in such a need of the job that I can't afford any mistakes .
I'm sure you'll pass it .
I need you to tell me what the problem is .
The bathroom sink is stopped up .
Is the kitchen plumbing messed up also , or just the bathroom plumbing ?
Just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem .
Did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ?
Everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago .
Are you going to be home so I can come by and take a look at the problem ?
I am not sure if I will be home later .
I will be coming by around 10 this morning . If you aren ' t there , I ' ll just use my key .
Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O ' Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ' star players .
Oh .
Wait a second . He shoots , he scores !
All right !
Here comes Jordan , though .
Wow , Michael Jordan ' s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch .
Yeah . He ' s older , so he doesn ' t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ' s still amazing .
Which team do you think will win ?
The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has .
No , I don't think we have .
My name is Gao Run .
How do you do ? My name is James Green .
Here's my name card .
And here's mine .
It's nice to finally meet you .
And I'm glad to meet you , too .
Come in please .
Good evening , sir . I come to make the bed . Shall I do it now or later ?
Well , since you have come , do it now please ?
That's all . Have a nice stay here .
Thank you . Please get some soap for us .
Just a moment . I will do it right now .
Wait ! Look at that board , what's on it ?
' Please don't enter the bamboo groves . ' We're not allowed to go in .
Then we'd better not go .
OK .
What ? Why do we have to do that ?
Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .
I see . That ' s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !
That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ' s eight time zones east of Greenwich !
That ' s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ' s like we went back in time !
A new car . And I've got a small family , two children , and I haven't got a lot of money and ...
Oh , oh , Madam , Madam , I'm afraid you have the wrong number .
Isn't this the car store ?
No . It's Mike's Sporting Goods .
Oh , sorry . Do you know the number for a car store , then ?
No . I don't . I suggest you look in the phone book .
I'm sorry to have bothered you .
No problem .
So you have all the news on broadcast ?
Yes , it's so helpful .
Actually , it ' s a little bit silly .
Don ' t worry about it , just ask .
What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes ?
You need to know the type of shoes you want .
Don ' t worry about that . I can point it out in the store .
The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . In girls shoes , the heel can be high or low .
Let me write all that down . I ' m going shopping this afternoon .
Wait a moment . I will calculate it for you . Your bill comes to $ 36 .
Here are $ 40 . Keep the change . That's my tip for you .
I ran a red light ?
Yes , you did .
I apologize , but I didn't realize that I did .
Weren't you taught that yellow means slow down , not speed up ?
I did learn that .
So , then why did you speed up ?
I don't know what to tell you .
I'm going to have to write you a ticket .
I understand .
Here you go . Don't do that again .
What are the internal factors that influence the company ?
The internal factors are composed of human resources , team spirit , innovation spirit and coordination between different departments , etc .
Oh , thank you .
Could I interest you in our store credit card ?
No , thanks . I already have credit cards .

My major was computer science when I was at college , and I am quite familiar with Visual C + + and Java language .
Well , what do you think about the development in computers ?
The developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software . In some regions , the hardware is completely replaced by software . So I think the software industry has a great future .

Those are the only things you eat ?
That's basically what I eat .
Why aren't you eating anything else ?
Well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy .
And the chicken ?
It's really healthy to eat when you bake it .
I guess that does sound a lot healthier .

Yeah , but what kit lens does this camera come with ? I don ' t want some bulky telephoto lens .
Oh , well this one has the , uh .
Looks to me like an 18-55 mm lens . pretty standard , that will do . Not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything !

Accessories ? Do you carry polarizing filters ?
Polarizing filter um we should ! I ' m sorry , ma ' am . It looks like we ' re sold out .

I'm worried that everything will be chaotic !
Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests .
You're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ...
I will . Don't worry !
Yes . I have just booked two tickets .
Tickets ? What tickets ?
Two air tickets .
Air tickets ?
Yes . We will fly to Paris the day after tomorrow .
We ? The day after tomorrow ? What are you talking about ?
Today is June 18 , isn ' t it ?
Yes . So ?

Yes . Think about it carefully .
Oh , come on . Tell me please . Why did you book tickets to Paris ?
Oh , honey ! Don ' t you remember this important day to us ?
Sorry .
It is our 10th wedding anniversary this June 20 .
Our 10th wedding anniversary ?
Of course . You completely forgot it .
Darling . I think you have made a mistake .
I have made a mistake ?
Yes . We married on July 20 ten years ago .
July 20 ? But I think it should be June 20 .
Yes . We had planned to marry on June 20 , but something happened , so we had to put off our wedding day .
Yes . I remember now . We put it off . I did make a mistake . But how shall we deal with the tickets ?
Since you have booked . Then let ' s celebrate our wedding anniversary before hand .
Let's line up . The steak is very inviting . I'll have it .
I'll have ham and egg with French fries . What dessert do you want ?
Banana pie .
Where shall we sit ?
How about there ?
Are you also suffering from pain and fever ?
Yes , and I also have the runs
I'll give you some tablets that should make you feel better . One moment , please . Here you are . Take these tablets three times a day swallow them with water .
When should I take them ?
Take on after each meal .
How long should I continue taking them ?
Take them for two days . If your symptoms persist for more than two days , you should see a doctor Also , be sure to drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration .
Thank you for your advice .
I went to Salt Lake City on business . What's up ?
I got fired .
How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ?
It's a long story . In a word , I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up .
What are you going to do now ?
I am trying to find a job asap . Lily doesn't know yet . I didn't tell her . I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought I went to work as usual .
That's not the way to solve the problem . Did you look in the classified advertisements column ?
Yes , I did . But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in .
Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand .
I just don't know how to bring it up . Well , all right . She has the right to know anyways .
That's more reasonable . I'll take this one .
Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department .
Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will .
Thank you . How much is the fare to that stop ?
One dollar .
How many stops are there ?
Two stops after this one .
Could you please tell me when we get there ?
Sure .
By the way , do I need a transfer again after No . 50 ?
No , a No . 50 will take you right there .
Thank you .
I am sure you can do better than that .
Sorry , sir . It's the sale price .
Well , what about $ 70 with a scarf ?
It's my rock bottom price . Take it or leave it .
This is our rock-bottom price , and we can't make any further reduction .
If so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks .
Then what ' s your counter-offer ?
This is our counter-offer .
We are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great .
So are we . Our counter-offer is in line with the world market .
How about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ?
Agreed .
No problem ! We have a broad selection of suits , all tailored made so that it will fit perfectly .
Great ! I want a three piece suit , preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool .
Very well sir . Would you like to have some shirts made also ?
Sure . I ' ll also take some silver cuff link and a pair of silk ties .
Very good . Now , if you will accompany me , we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts .
Yes , thank you . May I ask for an apartment ?
No problem . We'll supply you with an apartment of two bedrooms and a living room .
Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive .
Really ? Even for such an excellent one ?
I heard that you are interested in our silk skirts and new style of coats .
Yes , I've brought a list of your recent products with me . We'd like to import some of your latest clothes for the second half of this year . We're ready to place an order with you .
Great ! B , most of the items listed are available this year . I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts , so as to enable our timely delivery .
That sounds good . But I have a proposal now .
What's the proposal ?
Both of our two parties were involved in the discussion previously . Shall we also allow some of our clients to join us ?
Good idea ! In this way , our clients ' needs will be met and disagreements between the two parties avoided .
Sounds like we have the same idea .
Shall we have dinner together ?
Do you have a special restaurant in mind ?
Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food .
OK . I'll be happy to join you .
So you're quite happy with your new job ?
Right . I enjoy what I'm doing .
Thanks . Let ' s go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ?
Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . See 5PM , ok ?
No problem . See you !
See you !
Did you buy anything ?
Yes , I bought a few things .
What did you buy ?
I bought this coat . Do you like it ?
Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ?
At the mall on 5th street .
Was it expensive ?
No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars .
That's cheap .
I know . It was a really good deal .
I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately .
So , are you going to go to class tonight ?
Maybe ... but I don't think so .
Really ? What's the matter ?
I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad .
Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner .
Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already .
I love history , but I ' Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened .
I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks !
Some people say that history repeats itself .
What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ?
The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same .
I see . I think I ' d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .
A thousand dollars .
Let me check with a credit manager . A record show your credit reading is quite high . I don't think you have any problems .
What ' s the current interest rate ?
Our monthly interest is 1 . 5 % of the outstanding balance . Would you please fill out the application the form ?
I think someone is stalking me .
No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?
I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring . He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .
What did you do ?
I didn't do anything . Finally , he left . But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .
Did he leave when you left ?
Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .
What did you do ?
Yes , please . I can't stand watching the channel any more .
I think they have pretty good programmes . But I'll change it if you really want .
Put it on Channel 5 , OK ?
Oh , I hate Channel 5 . I'd rather just listen to the radio .
Don't make such a fuss . I'm sure you will like today's programme .
What's on today ?
A basketball match between Chinese team and American team .
Really ? I'm interested in it .
It might begin now .
Any rain ?
No , but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow .
I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days .
From Canada ? Where were you born ?
Montreal .
When did you come to Los Angeles ?
We moved here when I was fourteen .
Did you go to school here ?
Well , I went to high school here , but I went to college in Texas .
Did you get a job right after graduation ?
No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France .
When was that ?
Let's see ... That was about six years ago .
I bet that was interesting . What did you do there ?
I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me . How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ?
That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate .
And I can purchase that here ?
Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us , the Insurance Premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle .
That means it will get hotter .
I am dying from the heat .
Turn on the air conditioner .
It doesn't work .
What happened ?
I don't know .
Did you call the repairman ?
Of course .
When is he coming ?
He's busy . He said next week .
If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final .
No way , if it still has 21 .
What are they ?
They are keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
And what is the most important point ?
You should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .
Nice to meet you , Mr . Peter . I ' m Wang Sian . I ' Ve come for an interview as requested .
Oh , yes . How do you do , Miss Wang ? Sit down , please .
Thank you .
What was your major in school ?
I majored in Public Relations .
Have you done any work in this field ?
Yes , after my graduation , I worked in a trade company in Macao for one year .
What section did you work in ?
The export Business Section .
So you must be very familiar with export procedures .
Yes , very much .
That's good .
But you should tell me you were in love with her .
Didn't I ?
You know you didn't .
Well , I am telling you now .
Yes , but you might have told me before .
I didn't think you would be interested .
You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?
Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .
Oh , you men ! You are all the same .
I got poison oak while hiking , and I need something to help me with the itching .
I can suggest a product called Techne that comes in a lotion or cream .
Which do you prefer ?
Hikers tell me that the cream is best because it stays on longer .
Is there anything else I can do to help with the itching ?
You can take an antihistamine .
Thank you so much for all of the information .
You are welcome . Please feel free to ask me a question any time you need help .
oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ?
we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec
wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait !
tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ?
perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank .
no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .
we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning .
great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain .
no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week .
Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us .
Do you know when he will be back ?
He's away on a business trip . He won't be back until some time next week .
Is there some way I can get into contact with him ?
The best way to reach him is by cell phone . I'll give you his number .
Thanks . And could I have his e-mail , just in case I can't get him by phone ?
Sure . His cell phone is 09112223 33 . And his e-mail is lower case t , smith--that's one word , at , c , c , w , dot , com , dot , t , w .
Thank you so much . Does he read his e-mails daily ?
Yes . He usually replies immediately .
Great . Thanks again . You've been very helpful .
My pleasure . I hope you get a hold of him .
Because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse .
You see , This time I traveled to the West . When I looked out of the windows of the rain , all the lands that I could see are as dry as a bone .
It is serious .
Oh , do you go hiking often ?
I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature .
It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ?
Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ?
Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike .
Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city .
Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest .
Well , bring him along too . We ' ll have a great time this weekend .
Thanks , I ' ll ask him .
You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks .
That give us a good lesson .
Sure , just a moment . ... I'm sorry no one answer the phone .
All right , could I leave a message ?
Certainly !
Please ask her to call John .
Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
I'm quite outgoing i think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself I think . A friend in need is a friend in deed . The more really close friends I have , the better .
What kind of people do you like to work with ?
People who are honest , dedicated to their work and having integrity .
It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day .
You forgot all of about it , didn't you ?
Why ? You're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands ?
I have so much house work to do . I have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends .
How about your husband . Does he help much ?
Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ?
That sucks .
If he wasn't so lazy , I think I wouldn't have any complaints . He mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ?
That's crossing the line .
Oh well . I'll have to live with it . What else can I do ?
Are you saying that there weren ' t any problems ?
I will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem .
Will I be able to read the results on the website and understand them ?
Yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about .
How will I know what the numbers mean ?
You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range .
How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ?
We put all of your test results up in the same place . Just check the dates for what you need .
No , I never wear suit in my everyday life . I just want one to take part in my sister ' s wedding ceremony .
I see . Have a look at this one . It ' s very cheap because it ' s not very durable .
but it looks good . Let me try it on .
Ok , the mirror is over there .
Right . And China is the homeland of tea .
Yes , Chinese people love drinking tea so much . Some even claim they can't live without tea .
Do you know there are several catagories of Chinese tea ?
Yes , I believe there are green teas , black teas and scented teas . Any Others ?
Well , have you ever heard of Oulong tea and compressed tea ?
Oh , yeah . Oulong tea is good for one's health . isn't it ?
You surely know a lot about Chinese tea .
Sure , I like drinking tea at teahouses .
Oh , so do I .
Why don't we go for one now ?
Great . We can chat while enjoying a cup there .
Let's go !
What was your major at university ?
I studied economics , I am especially interested in the economic development of China .
What course did you like best ?
I like Business Management , and i think it's very useful for the present work .
What do you think is the relationship between the subjects you've taken and the job you are seeking ?
I've taken courses on office administration , reports and correspondence writing . I think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager , because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
I firmly believe that you love your brother very much .
Absolutely . By the way , do you sell any traditional Chinese medicine ?
Yes , we have some Chinese medicine for common cold .
I heard Chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure .
It depends . It's true that you can take some for prevention .
I'm sorry to hear that . I'm afraid it is often the case during the peak hours . Shall I ask them to call you when the line is free ?
OK . Please do so if it is not troublesome .
No trouble at all . May I know your name and room number ?
I'm Du Juan , in Room 312 .
I see . Wait in the room , please .
Thank you for your kindness .
It's $ 20 . If you are staying for more than 3 days in the city , the charge is $ 16 per day .
That's reasonable .
I want to get cigarettes .
You can use quarters , dimes and nickels .
No , we just don ' t usually admit it !
Well , thanks for the compliment anyway !
But I think Henry is a backroom boy . He always helps her with her study .
You're right .
I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas .
That is right up my alley . You say party and I'm there .
Perfect . It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people .
Will it be an all day event ?
Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library .
That was quick thinking .
Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great .
Yes , me too . But I'm disappointed .
Where were you ?
I was in New York for a wedding .
And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water .
Exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together .
There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming .
That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games .
Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you .
My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you .
OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool .
Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that .
What kind of food do you usually eat ?
I try my best to eat only fruits , vegetables , and chicken .
Is that really all that you eat ?
That's basically it .
How do you stick to only those foods ?
Actually , fruits and veggies are really good for you .
Yeah , I know , but what about the chicken ?
I mainly eat baked chicken , because there's not a lot of fat .
That does sound pretty good .
I know it does , and that's because it is .
I tell you what , 2:00 is not available for me , but you can get started and I'll come by at around 3:00
That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ?
Perhaps one year , I'm not sure .
I'm having some trouble . How do you use this printer ?
Well , first you have to turn this switch on .
Silly me .
Now press this button .
Oh , and it's out of paper . Do you have any more ?
Just a second . I'll go get some .
But isn't it served with cold milk ?
Yeah . Cold milk wakes me up .
Chinese people don't like to eat cold food .
Is that right ?
But I'm open to new things . I'll have a bowl of cereal , too .
With cold milk ?
With cold milk !
I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour . There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out .
Yes , I almost slid too . Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ?
Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped . Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .
Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop .
There . Stop !
I'd like a flower-and-bird painting .
How about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? It was painted by a famous Chinese painter in King Dynasty .
Oh , they look just like live cranes .
And what is more , in traditional Chinese thinking , cranes and pine trees symbolize longevity .
What's wrong with her .
She is expecting .
Congratulations to you .
Thank you .
What do you mean by " us " ?
Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married . Remember ?
What do you mean ? We ' re talking now , aren't we ?
Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together .
Yes . I remember . But we never used to argue . You used to think I was wonderful . Where are you going ?
Back to live with my parents . That's something else I used to do before we were married . Remember ?
Wait a moment , please . Let me check it .
By the way , I want a large room .
Right now we have a suite for 4 people , do you want to book it ?
Yes , that's what I am looking for . I will take the room for 2 days .
Yes , Ms . Reese . I remember , you spoke with me . Is there a problem ?
Well , it still hasn ' t gotten here , and my boss is pretty angry about it .
It looks like it may rain soon .
Yes , and I hope that it does .
Why is that ?
I really love how rain clears the air .
Me too . It always smells so fresh after it rains .
Yes , but I love the night air after it rains .
Really ? Why is that ?
Because you can see the stars perfectly .
I really hope it rains today .
Yeah , me too .
He knows a lot about law and he ' s eloquent , too .
Yes , we have one copy left .
Can you hold it for me ?
Ok , it comes four dollars twenty cents .
Here is five dollars .
Here is your change . Please wait for your receipt of the registered mail .
I also want to pack up my package . This is the notes .
Let me see . En .. just a minute . Here it is . I need your signature on this note .
Oh , one more thing , where can I mail this letter ?
Drop it in the mail box mark out of town . at that corner .
Thank you very much .
You ' re welcome .
that ' s a really long line . How long do you think it ' ll take to get through all those people ?
it takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ' ll probably be about an hour ' s wait .
can I buy stamps here ?
sure . How many would you like ?
I need 30 for my Christmas cards .
are you sending them abroad ?
twenty of them are going abroad to China and America .
do you have any going anywhere in the EU ? If you do , those are less expensive .
no .
ok , here you go . That will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence .
and the bubble wrap ?
that ' s another quid .
thanks a lot . You ' Ve been very helpful .
Wow , that's cutting it close ! That means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! What gate is it at ?
It ' s at ... gate 14 .
Oh , great ! That ' s at the other end of the terminal !
OK , so here ' s the plan ; When we land , run to gate 14 !
I ' m be right behind ya !
It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent .
Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it .
Is classical music your favorite ?
Yes . What about you ?
I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .
Pop music doesn't have any depth for me .
Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it .
Did you always like pop music .
I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music .
I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life .
oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play .
Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy .
John Smith , the escaped criminal .
That bad egg , who took the low road since he was a boy .
I think I must report to the cops .
Ok .
I'm pleased to meet you , Mrs . Green . My name is Myra . I work in Beijing Institute of Technology . I came here to meet you .
How do you do ?
How do you do ?
It's kind of you to meet me at the airport .
Welcome to Beijing . Is this your first time in China ?
No , I have visited China several times , but it's my first visit to Beijing and I think it's a great honor to be invited to your beautiful city .
It's our pleasure to have you here . I hope you will have a pleasant stay here .
Thank you . I'm sure I will have a wonderful time here .
Are you more of a leader or a follower ?
I don ' t try to lead people . I ' d rather cooperate with everybody , and get the job done by working together .
Do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English ?
Yes , in most circumstances .
Are you available for travel ?
Yes , I like travelling . I am young , and unmarried . It ' s no problem for me to travel frequently .
Have you just been to the cinema ?
Yes , I have .
What ' s on ?
Paris in the Spring .
Oh , I ' Ve already seen it . I saw it on television last year . It ' s an old film , but it ' s very good .
Paris is a beautiful city . I have never been there . Have you ever been there , Ken ?
Yes , I have . I was there in April .
Paris in the spring , eh ?
It was spring , but the weather was awful . It rained all the time .
Just like dear old London !
And how long do you you plan to remain in the United States ?
I ' ll be here for approximately three weeks . See , here ' s my return ticket for the twenty-sixth of March .
And , who is sponsoring your trip ?
My brother , here , this is an invitation letter from him . I will stay with him and his family in their home .
Alright , tell me about the ties you have to your home country .
Well , I own a house . actually , I ' m leaving my dog there with my neighbors . I have a car at home , and oh , my job ! I ' m employed by Tornal as an engineer . Actually , I only have three weeks ' vacation , so I have to go back to work at the end of March .
And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ?
Well , I do have assets in my country . like I said , I own a house , and see , here ' s a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance .
I ' m sorry , sir , we cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time , instead , you are granted a resident visa ! Congratulations , you are the millionth person to apply for a visa ! You win ! Congratulations !
I really feel like having a big juicy steak !
Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ?
I didn't know you were a vegetarian !
I'm not , I am a vegan .
A what ?
A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood .
Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough !
It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult .
How are your typing and shorthand skills ?
I can type 80 words a minute , basically no mistake , and can take dictation in English at 120 words per minute .
Why not use staircases ? The terror was not so violent at that time .
That would be too late .
Maybe the situation is too urgent .
Yes , I think I should have jumped in any case .
My name is Jessica . It's nice to meet you .
Yes . It's nice to meet you too . Are you a new student too ?
No . I'm a sophomore . I take it you are a new student ?
Yeah . It's pretty exciting to be here .
Have fun while it lasts . The excitement wears off real quick . Especially after you see how much homework you get . Where are you from ?
I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here .
I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea .
Why were you in Japan ?
My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures .
That's pretty cool .
I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents .
Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around .
Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class .
Ok .
Do you feel ok ?
Not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu .
Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now .
Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ?
You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down .
Ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting .
Zach , what's that on your arm ?
I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing .
It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ?
Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .
I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go .
Shouldn't we make an appointment first ?
We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse .
Whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting !
Thanks . It's a little tight . Do you have any in a larger size ?
Sure . I'll give you the next size up . That one is small , right ?
Yes . Also , I'm not so sure about the color .
Well . It doesn't go with your skirt . I think the color itself is fine though .
I hope so . A good journey to you !
Thank you .
He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ' t have the money yet .
Well , he should pay you back . It ' s only fair .
Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ' t have got angry .
Did you lend him a lot of money ?
Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back .
Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ' s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ?
No , we didn ' t . I guess you ' re right . We should patch things up .
Of course you should . You wouldn ' t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ?
I'm afraid I can't . I have a dinner party at seven tonight . You see , I am going to England the day after tomorrow .
Well , I won't keep you then . It was very nice of you to come to see me .
It has been a pleasure . Goodbye .
Goodbye . Thank you again for coming .
You sound exhausted . Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out ! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities . She can also help you do some household chores , and run so
Oh , I don ' t know ... it ' s hard to find the right nanny . You have to consider her previous work experience , the responsibilities you give her , and how she interacts with the kids . I would love to have
I think you should definitely consider it ! This way you won ' t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ' ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . I can refer you this great
Oh , that ' s great . Thanks Grace . Can you give me her number ? I ' ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow . Maybe this way I won ' t be so tired every day , and Dan and I might even get to go
Does this mean that you have bad news for me ?
I just want to talk to you about the tests that I want to run .
Can ' t you just tell me now ?
I don ' t know anything for certain . We always do a double check if there is a question .
I want to see you right away .
You can come in this afternoon . If you are feeling too stressed , feel free to bring a friend along .
I know for sure that something is wrong !
Don ' t worry about a thing ; we are just taking a second look and talking .
Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels .
I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ?
Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said .
It must be interesting to study English .
Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss . Parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ?
Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet .
Sure . I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores .
Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ?
That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www . taobao . com or www . ebay . com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place .
Is the service charged ?
No . it's free .
Really . I'll get a computer at once .
Who won ?
China .
What is the score ?
China beat Brazil three to zero .
Wonderful .
I am happy to be speaking to a presidential candidate .
Would you like to ask me anything ?
What do you feel about gay marriage ?
I think everyone has the right to love who they want .
Would you legalize gay marriage ?
Yes , I would .
Many people won ' t like that .
I ' m sure they won ' t , but that ' s my view on gay marriage .
I really like you .
I really appreciate that .
I'm afraid there's been a mistake .
I'm sorry , sir . What seems to be the trouble ?
I believe you have charged me twice for the same thing . Look , the figure of 6 . 5 dollar appears here , then again here .
I'll just go and check it for you , sir .
No , honey , why didn't you go to cram school last night ?
Dad , I don't want to talk about it now .
Honey , if you don't want to go to cram school , you should tell me the reason why .
I'm sorry , dad . But I would rather stay at school than go to cram school .
Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ?
He asked me how long it took me to learn English .
But , you were born and raised in California !
Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes .
What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ?
You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice .
So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ?
I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it .
Are you sure he really got the message ?
Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English .
That's hilarious ! What did he say ?
He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good .
I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again .
I stay at No . 115 Fucking Road .
OK , a taxi will be there by 9:30 .
What are your rates ?
It is RIB 10 yuan initially and 2 yuan for each kilometer .
I have a lot of luggage . Will those fit in the taxi ?
Take it easy . I'll send a larger to pick you up .
Thank you very much .
Do you know where that memo about office procedures is ? I want to give my secretary a copy .
I ' m sorry . I have no idea . I haven ' t seen that for ages .
Um , ninety-five dollars ?
Yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ?
I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique . I didn't know I could get it cheaper somewhere else .
Of course ! Everything at Helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn't you shop around ?
I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive .
But I'm not used to looking up every new word when I'm reading a novel . I only look up the most necessary ones .
Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too .
What's the color of her eyes ?
Dark blue .
How so ?
He stays up untill all hours of the night , and he never lifts a finger to help .
Have you talk to him about it ?
Not yet , but I have to soon . He's eating me out of house and home . I caught him reading the fridge again last night
Ahahah , Maybe that will help you lose weight .
This is no laughing matter , Nick .
Sorry Paul . I couldn't help it . So why doesn't he give you a hand ?
He watch the tob too much . Now really I don't know . But I can't handle this much longer .
Well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , OK ?
Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses .
Well , I have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics . what you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors .
Yes , I really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school .
That's a problem .
Nice to meet you , Ms . Wang . You must be exhausted after your long trip from Canada .
Yes , it was quite a long flight . I'm glad to finally be here .
I am doing great ! Thank you for asking , Joe .
I was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight ?
I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper .
OK . What about going to the movies on Friday night ?
What were you planning on seeing ?
I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer .
How about " The Secret Life of Bees " ?
That's a chick flick !
Really ? Congratulations !
Thank you , Paul .
By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday .
Good , happy birthday to you !
Not so soon . It ' s not my birthday today . Well , you ' ll come , won ' t you ?
Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me .
My pleasure .
Where is the school cafeteria ?
It is the basement of that red building in front of the tower with big bells .
Where is the Computer Center ?
The Computer Center is on the first floor of the library .
Where is the library ?
The library is next to the Adminstration Building . The Adminstration Building is over there near the school ' s main entrance . There are school maps for free in the lobby of the Admin .
Thank you . I will go get one .
Sure . Glad to be of service . By the way , my name is Mike Sullivan . You will see me around a lot . I am running for President of the Student Government .
Well , hi ! My name is Eve Markowski . I am glad to meet you . With your friendly smile and helpful attitude . I am sure you will win .
Thanks you for the encouragement .
You are welcome . I ' d better go . Goodbye .
Have a good day . Bye-Bye !
What ' s wrong with her ?
She went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident .
How many chances have I given you ? I don ' t trust you any more .
You know how hard I've tried to give up drinking ? I ' d be lost without you . I won ' t let you go anyway .
Well , rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run , sitdown . Coffee ?
No , thanks . I ' Ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine .
Haha , I could never do that . I ' d be a zombie if I didn ' t have my morning coffee fix . Let ' s get down to business then .
Yes . I ' Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . The demand for phone cameras is growing , and Pear has been falling behind in the market .
That ' s great ! I ' m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . Is Pear still interested in having those ?
No , we ' re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
Surely . Let ' s get started by drafting a new contract .
America was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 .
In a way that's right . But the Vikings travelled there long beforeColumbus . And what about the Red Indians ?
All right . Ask me a question now .
Who invented the electric light bulb ?
That's easy . It was invented by Edison .
Correct . Now for a harder question . Who will be the first men on Mars ?
I can't answer that . But I think Mars will be visited by men before theed of this century .
Ask me a question now .
All right . What is the nearest planet to the sun ?
That's easy . It's .. er . Venus . NO . Pluto . No . Wait a minute . It's Anthe tip of my tongue . Oh dear , what is the nearest planet to the sun ?
Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched .
You can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees .
The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play !
Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men .
Do you mind if we watch it . I ' d really like to see it .
Well , I really wanted to see the football game .
Football game ? Ok , and you know what comes on next ?
I believe there ' s a sitcom .
Are you interested in watching it ?
Let me look in the TV Guide first .
Oh , I am sorry . What's on Channel 2 at 10 pm ?
If I remember correctly , it's a quiz show .
Do you want to watch it ?
Let's watch it together .
Would you like to sit near the window ?
Good .
Let's have a look at the menu . Oh , there isn't a menu . Do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ?
Yes , of course . Excuse me . Could you possibly let us see your menu ? Oh . They haven't got one either .
That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service .
A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ?
A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle .
But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you .
We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies .
I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free .
I am not sure .
Don ' t lose your reason . Go to find him and talk with him .
It's the circus .
I don't want to sit there and watch them torturing the animals .
Oh , come on , they give them treat too . Oh , look , that little monkey is so cute .
Cute ? Hope so .
Oh , it is coming to us , come on , Ben , get a banana to it .
Me ? No way , keep him away from me , please .
Why are you acting so strange today ?
I've said that I've got a problem with the circus . I'm not kidding .
That's weird !
Thank you .
I'm talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo .
Oh , I see . So , you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities .
No , no . I've got plenty left .
Now I'm confused again ! What is the problem ?
What am I going to do about souvenirs ?
Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs !
Yes , I've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs .
Sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items , and as a guest you get a discount .
Please ! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs .
I understand completely , sir . Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment .
Well , I thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today . That is , if you haven't promised to go with someone else .
That'd be wonderful , Peter . But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning .
I'm sorry I was such a grouch . It must've been the weather . When it rains I get depressed .
Forget it . I'll see you at 11:30 am .
His grandfather's money is not his .
I can't understand him anyway .
The company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company ID , batch , telephone , e-mail set-up and training .
Quite a lot . All them one afternoon ?
Yes , it is not easy .
It is OK with me . I enjoy being busy and learning new things .
Why do you hate to go outside ?
I meet too many jerks .
I agree .
This city is full of jerks .
Rude people are everywhere .
But what can you do ?
You can yell at them .
And they will yell back at you .
Yelling doesn't do any good .
No . The best thing to do is just stay home .
What if I need a roommate ?
There are websites that can hook you up with a roommate .
How much do apartments cost around here ?
It depends on what you want . Do you want a one - or two-bedroom apartment ?
I just need a one-bedroom apartment .
That will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month .
Would you come with me to look at apartments ?
I would be happy to look at apartments with you .
Oh , yea . I forgot . So how did it go ?
Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas .
Great , so what happens now ?
Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it .
How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .
What ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
Let's hope so .
Let's see ... I'm afraid the 16th is fully booked . But I have seats for the 17th .
The 17th will be fine .
And what date will you be returning ?
Hmm , I guess on the 28th .
Okay , you're booked on American Airlines flight 710 , departing JFK at 6
Sounds good . Thanks a lot .
Let's make a bet on who gets it .
OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night .
Thank you very much .
Please make sure to fasten your seat belt . We are to take off .
Are you staying at the Hilton ?
Yes , I have already booked a room .
Do you have many friends ?
Yes , I like to make new friends .
What do you usually do with them ?
We like to get together , chat and enjoy beautiful music .
Ok , wait a minute ... let's see . I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me .
What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ?
Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful .
That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day .
But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope .
I have reported it to the police .
We'd better prepare for the worst .
What problem are you having ?
There have been charges made on my debit card that I didn ' t make .
Do you have the statement for your card ?
Here it is .
What are the charges you ' re referring to ?
The last four charges on the page .
I ' m afraid we ' re going to have to investigate these charges .
How long will an investigation take ?
I honestly don ' t know , but we will freeze payment on these charges .
That sounds absolutely fantastic .
I prefer single breasted suit .
What about this one ? It's a very nice 3 - piece suit .
That looks great . Do you have ties here ?
Sure . No problem .
Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ?
Sure . Do you have my number ?
Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this .
No problem . I'll wait for your call .
Yes , after you ' Ve been here a year , you qualify for a three-day vacation
Only three days ?
That's the company policy .
What happens if I use up my sick days before the end of the year ? If I ' m sick an extra day or two , will my pay be deducted ?
Yes . That's the company policy .
It was the same as the last place I worked at . I was hoping you ' d be different .
You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ' t have to pay for my trip .
Congratulations . How lucky you are !
Thank you . I ' m leaving tomorrow morning .
I ' m sure you ' ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country .
I ' m sure I will .
Have a nice journey , Lily .
Thank you , David .
We ' Ve been looking around for many hours . What on earth are you looking for ?
Well , you know , those styles or colors don ' t suit me .
What style do you want ?
I want to buy a V-neck checked sweater , and it should be tight .
Oh , I see . How about the color ?
Quiet color .
I know a shop selling this kind of sweaters .
Really ? Let ' s go there .
I'm sorry , but Mr . Johnson is out at the moment . Can I take a message ?
Uh , yes , okay . Tell him John Suzuki called . That's S-U-Z-U-K-I .
Yes .
From Video TV .
Yes , Video TV .
Tell him I telephoned . I'd like to see him about the videotapes . Can he call me this afternoon ?
Yes , Of course . What's your telephone number ?
It's , area code 413 , 447-9626 .
That is 413-447-9662 ?
No , that's 447-9626 .
Oh , I'm sorry , 447-9626 .
Yes , that's right . Extension 162 .
Extension 162 . Okay , Mr . Suzuki . I'll give him the message .
Thank you . Good-bye .
Good-bye .
I think so . Yes , they get along so well .
I like him . He's good for her .
You're right . He sure is .
Do you like high heels or flat shoes ?
High hells , please . I want to wear them in formal situations .
I believe we met at a concert last year . I'm Taylor .
Oh , yes . I remember .
I will give you premium unleaded . Alright ?
Sure , why not ?
That is the pump you are in front of .
Is it expensive ?
It is the most expensive .
Well , I don't want it then . Can I move to another pump ?
Yes , I can give you regular unleaded . But you have to back up the car a little .
Give me regular unleaded then . I will back up . Can you wash my windows for me ?
I'm sorry , sir . This is not a full service gas station . I will help you fill the gas , but we don't wash windows here .
Really ? Well , I guess I have to get used to it .
Is your brother older or younger than you ?
He is five years older than me , He got married last Sunday . My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age .
Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice .
It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging .
Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ?
Yes , they say I would get a big sum .
Have you discussed it with your wife ?
Yes , she leaves it to me .
As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary .
I have to think about it .
How about the new bar across the road ?
Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too .
I agree , I had lunch there last week .
Excellent ! That sounds like a plan .
If you are free , maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . It will be fun , you will get to know lots of people .
Sounds great , I'd very much like to accept your invitation , thanks , when ?
Around six pm .
Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating .
No . thank you . I can handle it , but thanks for the offer .
Ok , I will see you then .
Great , have a good day , thanks again for the offer .
I told you already ! I ' m going to get my nails done .
Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ?
Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me !
Why ? I don ' t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
They don ' t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do .
What about a draft at 120 days sight ?
All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us .
A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due .
Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible .
I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries .
So do I .
A dessert sounds nice .
What kind are you thinking of getting ?
I want to get some pie .
What kind of pie do you want ?
I have no idea .
Do you want to know what kind of pie I like ?
Sure , what kind do you like ?
I love apple pie .
Oh , I love apple pie too .
There you go . Problem solved .
Why is the price so high ?
It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly .
Model of computers aren't compatible ?
Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities .
Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable .
But by then , the technology will be outdated .
True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge .
That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable .
This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product .
I guess you get what you pay for .
The information is scanty for me . And can you describe the responsibilities of the position ?
Yes . Copywriters are supposed to design and write articles for the advertising company .
Sorry , he's out .
What time you suspect back them ?
Sorry , I am not sure , can I take a message ?
No , thanks . I'll call back later .
That's fine . please call again later .
Ok , thank you . Goodbye .
Deborah already had her baby .
I didn't know that .
I thought you knew .
I honestly didn't know .
The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .
That's good to hear .
Will you go and visit them ?
Of course I will .
I just wanted to give you the good news .
Thanks for letting me know .
That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ' s really annoying !
Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ' s why the parking lot was flooded .
I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
And this one ? Too flashy ?
Nah , not too flashy .
Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ' t it hideous ?
I guess .
Are you even listening ? I ' m trying to have a conversation with you .
And I ' m trying to watch the game , but you ' re yapping on about your new clothes !
Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon !
Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ' s the third quarter and you ' Ve been blabbering on since the first !
Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
Oh no you didn ' t . You didn ' t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ' t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game !
When does it arrive ?
It should be due in at 7:30 a . m . tomorrow .
How much is the ticket ?
It's 86 coach and 175 berths
One berth , please .
What things impress you in your colleagues ?
I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment .
What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ?
The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior .
How do you organize and plan for major projects ?
I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario . Then , I set a timetable that's realistic . What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react .
Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure .
I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks . The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me . Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed .
How do you manage your time in a typical day ?
I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value . The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week .
Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion .
I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings .
Really ? What time do you go to work ?
I start work at three .
And when do you get home at night ?
I get home pretty late , around midnight .
So what do you do , exactly ?
I'm a TV announcer . Don't you recognize me ? I do the weather report on KNT !
Gee , I'm sorry . I don't watch TV .
Not me . I have to have my TV and watch whatever comes on .
How can you do that ?
Johnny , I wish you ' d stop reaching for things . Haven ' t you a tongue ?
Yes , Mother , but my arm is longer .
You are right . They sweep Nancy off her feet . And now she fell head over heels in love with him .
How wonderful it would be if I had such smiles !
Shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks ?
That sounds like a good idea .
I know a very interesting place .
Oh , do you ? Good .
It's a good day for a picnic .
Mexican , Japanese or Chinese would be great .
Oh , I know a place where you might like to eat .
Is it close by ?
It's down a block on the right ; can I show you the way ?
OK , I'd love the company .
This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it .
Room 202 , but I'm afraid we have to ask for a deposit of $ 200 .
T112 to Washington please .
May I have your name ?
That's Lincoln .
What ?
I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ...
What is it ?
Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others .
That makes you feel uncomfortable ?
Yeah . we never do that in a public office .
Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy .
I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding .
Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus .
Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ?
Yeah .
Oh , I'm shocked .
But Sunday is the same with Saturday . If you don ' t mind , that's OK .
Hum . Maybe it will be better . The most important thing is that I can have a day to relax after a week's work .
I see . We will go the day after tomorrow .
By the way , what kind of stores do we need to go ?
I want to buy some clothes in clothing store . When we are going back , go to the butcher's shop and buy some chicken .
Let ' s also go to the jewelry store to buy a crystal necklace . I want to buy one for you as your birthday present .
Thank you , darling .
Sorry , I forgot . I don ' t like seafood , neither .
Let ' s go over there and get some milk , a couple dozen eggs and some orange juice .
Let's get frozen juice . It is really good . We ' Ve got enough food . Let ' s go over to the check-out stand .
OK . But just let me pick up a bottle of cooking wine and oil as we go by .
What ' s the matter ? So angry . I ' m just playing a joke with you .
Because I have given him up as a bad job . Our relation has been over .
Have I used the one that my sister is sick ?
Yes , twice last week .
Are you sure ? I thought I said it was my mother .
I don't think so . But it could've been .
Well . You can trust me this time . My sister is definitely sick . I'm just coming from the hospital . They say she might even die .
I don't buy your story . Try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ?
I'll do my best .
Just try to be a little more punctual in the future .
I'm working on it . Really !
I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned .
Is it waterproof ?
Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am .
Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ?
Well , surfing , scuba diving ...
Right , OK . That , again , shouldn't be a problem .
And the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average , for that particular industry , for the first two quarters of the year .
Well , as far as I can tell , we qualify .
Of course we will need proof , originals and duplicate of everything . As soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed .
Why ? anything special there ?
It's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more .
Oh , really ? are there any snakes ?
Snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .
That's terrific . I can't wait to check it out .
Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?
Why not ? it's so cool .
But it will pose a risk to your health .
Pardon ?
I mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems .
Well , I didn't realize that .
I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .
Oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .
Yes , good luck , Maria .
Draft beer and cans beer . Which do you prefer ?
A draft beer please .
OK . Here you are .
Could I have some fruit ?
Of course . Wait for a moment , please .
But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .
Oh , that's how you see it .
Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat .
No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?
Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like .
Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?
Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered .
What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste .
Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag .
That's right . Seeing is believing .
I've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement .
That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear .
What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password .
It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough .
I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping .
Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .
That's a good idea .
It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it .
Certainly .
I'm very sorry to hear that . May I have your name and room number , please ?
Yes , it's Yao Lan . Room 406 .
And how many pieces did you have ?
Two suitcases and a handbag . The suitcases are blue and the shoulder bag is red .
Is there a name tag attached to them ?
Yes , there is .
We're very sorry for the delay . I'll check immediately and call you back .
I guess I need all of them .
Actually , the company will provide you with all of these supplies . So , you can leave this very thick notebook at home .
I know . But it is my lucky charm . I carry it all the time .
Suit yourself . Don ' t forget to set the alarm clock .
well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers .
do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ?
no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions .
it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America .
religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal .
what do you think about abortion ?
I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself .
do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?
I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children .
why not ? It's their children , too .
that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand .
that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter .
Here you are . Do you need to see my passport ?
Any form of picture I . D . will do .
Mmmm ... a photo I . D . I have my New Jersey driver ' s license . Is that ok ?
That will do . What an interesting picture ! How old is it ?
Actually it wad taken just last year , but I had a shaved head and a beard . Can you still recognize me ?
Barely . Will you be checking any luggage today ?
Yes , One suitcase . I also have a carry-on bag .
Ok . Mr . Lee , you ' re all set . Your flight leaves from gate 10 . Boarding begins at 10:30
With the job ?
With everything , with everybody , with all this !
A good suggestion for you . You need a holiday .
It wasn't always like this , you know .
What do you mean ?
Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives .
You need a holiday . That's what's the matter .
Certainly , perhaps .
Are you bringing in any plants or animal products ?
No .
Our sniffer dog seems to disagree . Do you mind if we look in your suitcase ?
Not at all . Go right ahead .
What ' s this sir ?
It ' s traditional Chinese Medicine . I mix it with hot water like tea . Sorry . I forgot about it .
What are these red things sir ?
Oh no ! I forgot about those too ! Those are Chinese sausages for my Aunt Lily .
I ' m sorry sir , but you can ' t take any of this into the country . We will also have to check your carry-on . Please step this way . Don ' t ' be nervous ; we ' ll just look through it briefly and then
I ' ll take them .
Here you go .
These books were due two weeks ago .
Yeah . I totally forgot they were due .
You will need to pay late fees on these books .
How much are the late fees ?
The fee is 25 cents every day .
I have to pay 25 cents a day ?
And that ' s for each book that is late .
That shouldn ' t be a problem .
Can you mail this at the post office for me ? I have to go to the doctor for an appointment and I don't have enough time to go to the post office .
Sure . And I'd like you to get some cold medicine for me when you go to the doctor's .
Shall I put some oil on ? B
I'm sorry , Mr . Baker is not in . May I take a message ?
Yes . Tell him Mr . Cook called and ask him to return my call soon as he gets back .
All right , Mr . Cook . I'll have Mr . Baker call you back as soon as he gets here .
What qualities do you expect the applicants to have ?
We expect the usher girl to be good-looking , no less than 165 centimeters high , and love smiling .
That is quite an achievement ! Do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
I don't think so . I'll create further achievement in the future .
Have you received any honors ?
Yes . I got the title of " Advance Worker " in 2006 .
Do you have any publications ?
Yes . I wrote a thesis entitled " On Interpersonal Relations in the Socialist Market Economy " and it was published in China Daily .
Now , tell me , what do you eat ?
Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .
Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
What do you drink ?
Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
I think that's just steam . Your engine's overheated .
Do you know a lot about cars ?
A little bit . I'll take a look if you want me to .
Please . Thank you so much for stopping .
Yeah , she's hot . Radiator's leaking . Looks like you were running her pretty hard .
That must have been just before I got the speeding ticket .
Did you have an accident recently ... Hey , wait a second ! I know this car !
You do ?
I ran into it a couple of weeks ago . What do you know ? Name's Hal .
I'm Akimbo . Nice to meet you , I guess .
Boy , I'm sure sorry about your car . Hey , Akimbo , I wonder if you'd like to make a deal ?
What kind of deal ?
I'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car .
You don't want your insurance company to pay for it ?
I'd rather not . They'll raise my rates . It'll cost me more in the long run .
If you give me cash , do you care if I don't fix the car ?
Hell , I don't care . Just don'T submit a report to your insurancecompany .
It's a deal , Hal . Thanks again for stopping to help . And thanks for smashing my car !
What ' the matter ?
The food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone .
I see . You simply can't blame the server for this .
Yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district .
That's true .
Anyway , how was your such , Catherine ?
It was good . I brought lunch from home today .
You did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America .
Well , I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy .
I guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat .
Yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , don't you ?
You bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America .
Well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places .
Seriously ?
Yeah , it's hard to believe but true .
Yes , how are you doing ?
Not bad .
Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening . Would you like to come with me ?
Sure . Thank you very much .
Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty . OK ?
Ok , see you .
See you .
Do you have a table for four , please ?
Yes , smoking or non-smoking ?
We'd like a non-smoking table , please .
Come with me , please .
That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ?
It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ?
Yeah . I think I can find it .
You're back already . That sure was quick .
That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me .
Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . Anyway . He said it was too close to closing time .
Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway .
Okay , let's go !
He's got a promotion .
You're kidding .
No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years .
Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul .
Well . Good for him .
How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother .
I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself .
Does your husband feel the same ?
Yes . He is very understanding and supportive .
What type of position are you looking for ?
I'm looking for a position in which I can utilize my experience .
Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position ?
I am more interested in a full-time position . However , I would also consider a part-time position .
Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ?
I advised customers on financial matters . After I consulted the customer , I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis .
What is your greatest strength ?
I am an excellent communicator . People trust me and come to me for advice . One afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
What is your greatest weakness ?
I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . However , I began setting time-limits for myself .
Why do you want to work for our company ?
After following your firm's progress for the last 3 years , I am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and I would like to be a part of that team .
When can you begin ?
Immediately .
What about soup ?
Sour-peppery soup .
Which condiment do you use for ?
I'll use ginger , garlic scallion , hot pepper and vinegar .
Very good , need I help you ?
No , don't need , I can do myself .
Thanks . I can watch TV now .
But you must cook that dinner next time .
Okay , I'll do it next time .
Really ! Here's my trophy .
Wow ! Congratulations !
Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
It ' s nice to meet you , Mr . Stevens .
Please call me Jack . Have a seat , please .
Thank you .
Yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough .
Oh , breaktime flies .
Come on , baby . It ' s time now .
Mam , another minute , could I ?
Hurry up , little boy .
Who is looking after him ?
My mother-in - law . She retired last year .
You really are lucky !
Yeah , I know .
What else do I need to do ?
You inform the people in charge and let them reserve dinning tables for guests .
Really ? Wow with who ?
This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months . She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend .
Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ?
Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat .
That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ?
It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy .
I guess it does seem logical . I'll have to check it out !
Cafe au lait , cafe latte , cappuccino , cafe mocha ... I can't keep them all straight !
Slow down . What are you talking about ?
It's about a girl . No , an angel ! I'm going to the coffee shop where she works right now .
What's wrong with it ? It's filthy !
Oh ...
It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
Sorry , love .
What are you looking for now ?
My cigarettes .
Well , they ' re not here . They are in the dustbin .
In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ?
I'm afraid I can't agree with you on that . I like D . H . Laurence ' s novels better .
I think I forgot to send it in !
You need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid .
Can I send it in now ?
You should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due . If it hasn ' t been , we will still accept it .
Can I mail it in early next time so it isn ' t late ?
Actually , you cannot mail it in early , as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date .
Will my paycheck come right away now ?
Your check will arrive a little late .
When was this break-in ?
I believe it happened last night .
Where was the break-in ?
It happened at my house .
Was anything stolen ?
I haven't checked yet .
Why do you think there was a break-in ?
My front window was broken .
We'll send a squad car shortly .
I'd appreciate that .
When will that be ready ?
The dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks .
You ' re getting married in three weeks . So that should be ok . So , you ' Ve prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel-everything .
Yes . We ' Ve taken care of all of that . We decided not to get married in a church though . Neither of us is very religious .
Which hotel will the reception be held at ?
The palace hotel they ' re taking care of the catering , including the wedding cake . I ' m sure they ' ll do a good job .
Oh , yes . It ' s and excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
Yes . It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . It gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people .
I think you make the right decision .
Experience is important , but don't you think capability is more valuable than that ?
Yes , I think so . But how do you prove to me that you are more capable ?
Maybe you can hire me on trial . If I'm not qualified for the job , you can let me go .
Good idea .
Now let's get things ready .
Don't worry . There are all kinds of things in the center .
That's much more convenient . We don't even have to bring the flavorings .
My skin is oily .
Then I advise you to buy the LAY cleansing milk .
Can you tell me more ?
Good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time .
Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ...
Is everything ready now ?
Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive .
Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .
Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet .
It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ' t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available .
Thank you .
My pleasure .
How much is it ?
It's free of charge .
Thanks so much .
But there are only two more days until the bidding closes !
I bid on a Chanel watch at the last minute , and got it sixty percent off !
Oh ... I'm such a newbie . But at least I'm sure I'll get that tennis racket .
Don't count on it , Babe . eBay is always full of surprises .
Well ... guess how low the bidding starts on the tennis racket ?
Oh , no . When we were poor , we often tried our best to make ends meet . It was a hard time .
But now you are rich .
And we have some squabbles on some boring things .
This is ordinary marriage life .
I want to find information on the American Civil War .
Well , can you be more specific ? There are a lot of websites about that .
Yes , I want to know about the battle of Gettysburg .
O . K . Well , go to google . com , and type in " Battle of Gettysburg . "
Oh wow , there are a lot of sites .
Here , try this one . It ' s a good site about Gettysburg .
Thanks .
For detailed information , however , you should read a history book .
Thanks . If I ' m interested , I ' ll go to the library .
What about the hotel accommodations ?
You'll be staying at Holiday Inn . It's a three-star hotel with two restaurants and a swimming pool .
Great . What types of things will we do at Lushun Falls ?
The second day you take a four-hour city tour . In the afternoon you go on the famous boat cruise under the falls .
I sure hope so .
Christine , I know you ' re new here and there ' s a lot to learn , but you are going to have to learn to keep your work in better order . We can ' t afford to lose an important document .
Yes , sir . I apologize for that . Here ' s the file you were looking for , Mr . Emory .
Where should we go eat today ?
How about we go eat in the cafeteria ?
I never bought food from the cafeteria .
You haven't ? They have a lot of good stuff .
What do they have ?
They sell everything .
Well , I want Chinese food .
I've gotten chow mein from there before .
I guess we can eat there then .
Trust me , the food isn't half bad .
Certainly . We have here the race apparatus , stationary bike , muscle builder set , chest expander , bar bell , dumb bell and so on .
Working in the gym is a very good way for losing weight . What else do you have ?
Here's the swimming pool . It's open from 10 a . m . to 11 p . m . There are also massage rooms here .
That's wonderful ! I like swimming .
oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ?
I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides .
what do you usually write about ?
at first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my family an
that's interesting . How often do you write a blog ?
it's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks .
got it . Are you still updating your blog ?
sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like .
good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months .
I want to buy some specialties . Can you recommend me some ?
Sure . I strongly advise you to buy a bottle of perfume and a lighter .
Fine . They look nice . I will take both of them .
May I have a look at your passport , please ?
We need an operator now .
It's just the job I've been searching for .
I think you ' re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we ' ll win ?
I really don ' t know . I don ' t think we ' ll win many gold medals , but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones .
What do you think our chance are in other events .
In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ' ll do well in those same events .
We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice .
I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total .
You are very optimistic !
But I never saw them .
Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them .
You mean that you can them .
That's right . I can see them in my dreams .
They come to the earth ?
No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space .
Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ?
OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings .
That means that you talk to them ? In which language ?
Of course in English , they learn English on Mars too .
Wow . Sounds fantastic !
Is that your wedding ring ?
I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring .
Well , congratulations . When is the big date ?
In June .
Did you have the watch before getting the ring ?
Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch .
You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous .
Thank you so much .
What kind of watch is it ?
It's a Tag Heer .
If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ?
This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .
That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for .
Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .
He ' s not very good at the long jump though , is he ?
He ' s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ' s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ' s fine for someone his age .
Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?
The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
How are they at swimming ?
They ' re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ' s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ' re not very fast , but that ' s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
I ' d be afraid to jump from that height !
I think that these kinds haven ' t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher .
It seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further .
Of course . I want to buy some night cream for my mom , and some masques for myself .
Hmm . In Carrefour , Clinique will be promoting their visible skin renewed cream .
How much is it ?
180 yuan , and you can get a free 8 piece gift package .
What's included in the gift package ?
Some black mascara , moisturizing orion , eye cream crystal lipstick , a two color eye shadow pack , styling hairspray , and a cosmetics bag .
Sounds not bad .
The seven-days trip shall be fine . How much is this tour ?
$ 300 .
We will take the trip . Could you give us a pamphlet ?
Here you are .
I got a ticket yesterday .
Really ? What did you get one for ?
I parked in the red zone .
Why did you do that ?
I needed to get something really quick .
Where did you park at ?
At my apartment building .
Don't you have your own parking spot ?
I needed to be fast .
That was very lazy of you .
Certainly , I can can help you with that . What type of account would you like to open ? A chequing or a savings account ?
What What features do they offer ?
Well , if you just take a look here , see , with our chequing account , you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee , and our savings account has a higher interest rate , but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars .
I see , well , I think I ' m more interested in a chequing account . I like to have easy access to my money .
Alright , then , with this chequing account you ' ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . Will you require overdraft protection ? There is an extra fee for that .
No , that won ' t be necessary .
In that case , I ' ll get you to fill out this paperwork . I ' ll need your social insurance number , and two pieces of government ID . If you could just sign here , and here , and here . we ' ll be all set . Would you like to make a deposit today ?
Yes , I ' d like to deposit one billion dollars .
Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ' t cost much .
Where will we sleep , then ?
In the van .
What about other expenses ?
Let ' s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ' t spend much . Come on . Don ' t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ' t we ?
Maybe you ' re right . When do you plan to go ?
The sooner the better ! I can ' t wait !
Oh , I don ' t know where we ' re going yet .
As long as we ' re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time .
Let ' s go to Chicago . We can have lunch in Chinatown . Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field !
You have such good ideas !
Certainly . Would you like it with ice cream ?
No , thanks .
Two muffins and a cup of coffee . Will it take long ?
No , just a few minutes .
But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ?
If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun .
Actually , I enjoy both .
So , what is most important to you in a job ? Do you need job security or professional growth and a chance to advance ?
I need job security .
Would you be able to relocate ?
I am open to relocating .
What are your annual salary requirements ?
I need at least 75,000 per year .
I ' ll keep that in mind . Thank you for coming in today . We ' ll be in touch .
Is it far ?
No . it ' s only five minutes walk . you can ' t miss it .
Thanks a lot
You are welcome
Yes , but I can't find Callaway Street .
Walk that way for about four blocks . The hotel's about two blocks north of there .
Thanks a lot .
Not at all .
Where did you spend your holiday ?
I went to Paris .
Oh , yes , you like skiing .
Right .
I can't forget it .
You'd better cool yourself down first .
We have a two-for-one special on large pizzas . Would you like a large pizza instead ?
Sure , that sounds good .
Great ! Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ?
No , make the second one with ham , pineapple and green peppers . Oh , and make it thin crust .
Okay , thin crust . Your total is $ 21 . 50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ' s free !
Perfect . Thank you . Bye ..
wait ! ! I need your address !
What do you mean ? It's a scrim .
Not to me , I wouldn't be caught dead in that .
I love that kind of stuff .
Yeah , you seem to like those styles .
Sure do . I get a kick out of looking punk .
This one looks really expensive though .
I don't care how much it costs . I'm rolling in it .
Lucky you ! I can't buy anything else . I'm flat broke .
I got a replace my party outfit , I trashed it last week .
Why did you drag me into this ? I've spent a week salary .
Are you on the level ? You're the one who called me , remember ?
Just joking , Tonia . I've got some wonderful clothes . Let's go and have a close look at your outfit .
Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .
Neither am I . So a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area ?
I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
How much do you think the rent will be ?
I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
Well , do you all major in the same subject ?
No , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating .
That's great !
You can say that again .
What companies do we have in our neighborhood ?
Mitsubishi , HP , IBM and many other famous corporations .
Does the 7th floor belong to our company too ?
Yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building .
It ' s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ?
Yes , at the end of the hall .
I saw her yesterday . She was a little better .
Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there ?
No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital .
Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ?
Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus .
Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 .
But number 13 buses leave from the center of town . You ' ll have to walk two miles to catch one .
We need to talk .
Okay ...
I ' Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people .
What ? Why ? I mean , we ' Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ' re happy together , aren ' t we ?
That ' s just it , I ' m not happy anymore , Tim . It ' s not you , it ' s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
So , what are you saying ? You ' re breaking up with me because I ' m perfect ?
Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ' ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ' d only hurt you , I know I ' d only make you cry .
Baby , come on . Don ' t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ' t leave me .
I can ' t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ' m only doing this for you . I don ' t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do .
Laura ...
Here are your keys . I ' ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ' m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ' ll always love you . Goodbye .
Well , look here . Ten new typewriters were delivered to my company yesterday afternoon and only five of them work properly .
Oh , I'm sorry about that .
Never mind being sorry , what are you going to do about it ?
Don't worry , we'll soon fix them .
Good , I hope you'll make sure that it won't happen again .
I'll certainly look into that .
Thank you . Goodbye .
I really don ' t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ' re running a busy office here . You ' re going to have to keep up .
You ' re right , sir . I apologize . I ' ll get those files for you now .
Sitcoms ?
Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values .
In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies .
I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time .
Sit down , please . Maybe you have read the contract , but I want to give you the details again before you sign the contract . You must have a three-month internship .
Yes , I know .
When you become a permanent employee , you will have the insurances . You will get monthly pay and will be on eight-hour / day work shift .
Wait , will I have five insurances and one fund ?
Yes . You can also enjoy legal holidays and year-end bonus .
It sounds great !
If you need to work overtime , you will get twice the usual salary as overtime pay .
OK .
You have read the relevant terms of the contract . Do you have other questions ?
How long will the induction training be ?
About two weeks .
I see .
If you don't have other questions , just sign here .
OK .
Is it useful for me ?
You have to try at least .
OK . Thanks a lot .
That's nothing .
I am so glad that you decided to stop by !
Yes , it has been a long time since we have seen you .
Mary , can I get Josh or you something to drink ?
Oh no , thank you . We aren't all that thirsty .
How about a little snack then ?
No , thank you , we just ate lunch a little while ago .
Well then , how is your family ?
Everyone is doing great . My sister finally had her baby .
Why do you like it best ?
I enjoy the various characters and the plot .
Well . I like the Thom Birds best .
Is it very interesting ?
Sure . I like the writer's language , too .
If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book .
Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
That's a good idea . Let's go !
Yes . What did you think of it ?
I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it . What did you think of it ?
Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ?
Mmm . That's what I thought too . I really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . And I always enjoy watching Pierce Brosnan .
Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ?
Not as much as last time , actually . What's the name of the American actor who was in the supporting role ?
Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . Did you like him ?
Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together , don't you think ?
I don't know . I think the woman was better . She provided a good love interest . Lucky James Bond !
Yes !
Well , thank you very much but I thought l'd try and chair the meeting by the rule -- at least for a while .
OK , OK !
Now , I'd like to get things under way . The main topic on today's agenda is the development of a U . S . sales strategy for the new EBB . I'd like to hear all of your ideas , Mr . Wall , you seem in top form today . Could you start the ball rolling ?
Uh , oh , sure . Well , I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising .
Well , that's kind of obvious .
Give me a break , Mr Yang .
Uh , let's keep this going , shall we ?
Jogging and bowling . Do you know how to practise Bungfu ?
No I don't But l do Taijiquan or Shadow boxing . People everywhere in China usually do Taijiquan early in the morning . It can help people keep fit . It has a history of over three hundred years .
Is it easy to learn ?
Yes . it is I can teach you if you like .
Thank you . I can teach you how to bowl .
Right . Let's help each other .
that ' s unless there is a traffic jam . It could take three hours .
you ' re right . We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up areas .
so , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ?
ok . You haven ' t seen my company car , have you ?
no . let me take a look ... it ' s longer than my car .
I think it ' s over five meters long . I can ' t remember exactly . It has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour .
wow ! That ' s fast ! I don ' t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway .
we can ' t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit .
It falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month .
Could you tell me the origin of the two festivals ?
OK . The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan . On that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river .
Why do people eat rice cakes on that day ?
In order to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body .
It sounds so moving .
Yes , of course . I am Monica . I have made an appointment with your HR manager .
Just a minute please . I ' ll make a call to the HR office . Yes , they confirm your appointment . Please come in . it is on the 3rd floor , room 3106 . You can take the right elevator as the left on is in maintenance today .
Thank you very much .
You ' re welcome .
How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn .
I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day .
Is it really worth paying for ?
I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter .
If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
Will this table be all right ?
Actually , I'd like a booth by the window if that's possible .
Certainly . How about this one ?
This will be fine , thanks .
( Handing her a menu ) Your waiter will be here in a minute to take your order .
Thank you .
Really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work .
It's important to do proper exercises .
You're right . Too much or too little won't do any good .
The trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
Sounds reasonable .
We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
And fruits !
Surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .
I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
Yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can also help one to keep sound physical health .
I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .
You bet it !
Yes , Mum .
Thanks .
An hour ago , I bought this vase with my tourist .
Oh , yes . I remember it clearly . Is there anything wrong with it ?
I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel .
Oh , how awful ! Let me have a look , I'm terribly sorry . It was most thoughtless of me . Would you excuse me , please ?
Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes .
It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ?
All right . Thank you .
Just a minute , please . I won't be long . I'm sure this one is perfect . You may examine it carefully .
Oh , yes , it is . I'll take this one .
I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you .
Well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing .
Some of us are going to start a soccer team . Would you like to join us ?
I don ' t know anything about it . Soccer isn ' t as popular in my country as it is here .
That ' s all right . We ' ll teach you .
Is it anything like American football ?
Not very much . It ' s something like hockey , except that you use a big ball and no stick .
I ' ll come down and watch you play some day , and see what it ' s like .
Good idea . I think you ' ll like it if you give it a chance .
What kinds of parades are there ?
The parades are usually military ones , but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs . What do you do on national day in your country ?
We don ' t have a national day .
Really ? That ' s unusual .
I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don ' t .
Actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . In the evening , many people watch special TV shows which celebrate national day .
No , Lily is not here at the moment .
Could you ask her to call me back when she gets in ?
Sure . What ' s your number , please .
519 367 8901 .
Thanks . And your name is Tony , right ?
Yes . I ' m Tony . Thank you very much .
You ' re welcome . Bye .
Bye .
I don't really know . Why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? They will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . He can even help you avoid paying tax legally .
If I don't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ?
Certainly . No one who evades tax can escape from their detection . They ' ll check your income through computers . You'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . If you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined .
I was just watching TV . What's going on with you ?
I just watched a movie and I'm scared .
What did you watch ?
I saw the Sixth Sense . I didn't know it was going to be so scary .
I remember that . It was a great movie . But it was definitely scary .
If you're not busy , do you want to come over ? I'm afraid to be alone .
Sure . I can come over . What should we do ?
How about if we watch a comedy . I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense .
Ok . I'll get ready and leave . I'll see you in about 20 minutes .
Hurry , ok . It's dark out .
Don't worry , nothings going to happen . I'll be there real soon .
Ok . See you soon .
It's a green drink . It's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals .
You know , healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag .
The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins .
Have you ever tried it ? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ?
It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day .
It may take less time , but I don't know about easier . Yuck .
This is your song . I picked it for you .
Thank you . You are so considerate .
Push the red button on the mike to turn it on .
OK . This key is too high for me .
I think it's a piece of cake for you .
OK . Let me have a try ...
Well done ! I hope I can sing as well as you one day .
Thank you . I'm sure you will .
I hope so . Thank you for saying so .
I see , may I ask what the occasion is ?
It ' s not really an occasion , it ' s more like I ' m sorry .
Very well . This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
I think I ' m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ?
Mmm , well this is our I ' m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
I don ' t think that ' s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better !
I ' m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ?
Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .
Get out of my store , you jerk !
But I want to watch TV now .
That ' s out of the question .
Please .
Not a chance .
Not even for an hour ?
Sorry , it ' s impossible .
I'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so I
Do you think I believe the story like that ?
But it's true .
How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ?
That's coincident .
Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time .
I promise I will .
You'd better .
Get in . I'll take you .
About how much will it cost ?
It will cost you $ 10 .
By the way , what's the time ?
You can see the time on the meter . I have radio time , you know .
It's a quarter to 12 . Could you please drive a little faster ?
Certainly .
I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected .
You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where .
I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies .
But you must take the design and quality into consideration . You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with .
I agree that yours are of the top .
Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ?
To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help .
Impossible . How about 5 % off ?
Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable .
This one here .
Ar , Yes . There ' s a big cavity .
Can you fill it ?
I ' m afraid not . The tooth is too far gone . it'll have to be taken out .
Then I might as well have it done now .
you ' d better wait , the gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days .
It better be more than last year .
Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see .
There is that .
I believe it'll be very expensive .
let's take a look at the menu so we can order . Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?
what would you rather have , samosas or poppadoms ?
I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .
well , let's get a plate of those then .
sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ?
I think I might have a dahl .
what's in a dahl ?
it's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .
that sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
ok . How about some lamb kebabs ?
that's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ?
I think I'll have a beer .
ok , shall I flag down the waitress ?
I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round .
you're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me !
what would you do without me ?
Yes . Our bank is authorized to deal with foreign exchange .
What kinds of currency do you change ?
We can change only three kinds of currency , USD , Japanese Yen and HK Dollar in our savings office .
Could you tell me what the exchange rate for USD is today ?
The buying rate is 826 . 44 yuan for 100 dollars .
I want to change some Us dollars to cover my expense here .
Please go to Counter No . 2 , the foreign exchange counter . It's over there .
Thank you .
Don ' t worry him , he has been grown up and I think he can take himself very well .
But he still does not come back .
Maybe he is on the way home now .
Here is a present for you . I hope you like it .
Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time .
I'm very glad to hear that .
Come here , let me introduce some friends to you .
I guess we'll see just around .
Ye , I hope so . well . Take it easy .
You too .
The Grand Hotel ?
Yes . Do you know where it is ?
No , Madam . I don't think I do .
It's the 11th Avenue , Park Street .
Oh , yes . I know where it is .
Sure .
Let me just make sure . You want to withdraw one thousand dollars ?
That's right .
And it takes up all the news .
The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up .
It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public .
Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio .
I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio .
Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line .
Then review for your test . You'll do even better . And maybe reading will help you get to sleep .
Aw , Mom-you're such a drag .
You say that now , Lily , but you'll thank me later . I'm your mom , and mother knows best .
What's he doing ?
He's checking bags . He ' s an official in the customs .
Oh , In what way .
No appetite , always unaged and I can ' t sleep well .
Did you lose any weight ?
YES . I ' Ve lost quite a few pounds since last month .
when was the last time you have track up ?
About two month ago .
Let me take your blood pressure . You look anilic . Well , Mr . Brown . I ' m happy to say it ' s nothing serious . You just a little run down from overwork .
What am I suppose to do ?
I think you ' ll needs just vacation . Try to get out doors more . I ' ll be sure if you get more rest .
Thank you , doctor . I ' ll do what you say .
Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them .
Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ?
I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves .
You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different .
How much will that run me ?
It depends on traffic and distance , but it is reasonable .
Do the drivers speak English ?
Some are better than others . But , you shouldn't have a problem .
Are they safe ?
For the most part , yes . If you don't feel comfortable with it , then it is best not to take one at night .
I guess this is a good excuse to surf the Net on someone else's dime .
Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic ?
He must have just got online for the first time last week . He still thinks it's some kind of new toy .
Yeah . All of us tried our best .
Congratulations !
Well , I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true !
Of course it does ! They tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house . I think most of the times they are just scam artists .
Well , historically it is a practice that many cultures share . Reading the tarot cards , in the east they would even read tea leaves ! I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes .
All superstitious nonsense ! I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks .
What research ?
Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ?
But they're just ads .
Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends .
Not at all . We've really enjoyed having you . I hope you'll come and stay again next time you're in Changsha .
Here is your ticket .
Thank you .
The park will close soon . We Should better go in right now .
Really ?
Yes , let's go in .
It is a new park , isn't it ?
Yes , how do you know ?
I guessed it .
Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well .
Oh , how wonderful !
Sure , John Sandals .
Hi , Mr . Sandals . I'm Michelle , at your service . When do you need the room ?
My plans are to be there April 14th to the 17th .
We have new room rates , sir . Will that be acceptable to you ?
Well , it depends on the price , of course . What is it ?
It's $ 308 a night .
I have no problem with that .
Great ! Would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking ?
Definitely nonsmoking . I can't handle that smell .
Nonsmoking . Now , is a queen-size bed okay ?
No problem .
Great , Mr . Sandals . Your reservation is confirmed . Now all I need is your phone number .
Of course ! It's area code 626-555-1739 .
Thank you so much , Mr . Sandals . We look forward to seeing you !
Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .
He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him .
Me too .
Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .
Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?
Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited .
He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .
And the host announced that he won it all !
Would you care for a drink before you order ?
A glass of Qingdao beer .
Yes , sir . I'll bring it over . Have you decided what you'd like , sir ?
Will you make some recommendation ?
How do you do ? Please be seated , How is your trip here ?
Quite good , I think . I came here by bus , and it took me about 15 minutes .
Oh , yes . How old are you ?
Twenty .
Hum , still a student ?
Yes , I'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics .
What subjects are you studying ?
English , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy .
Have you had any working experience .
Well , I worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays .
What do you like to do in your spare time ?
I like sports very much . Besides that , I also like working on a computer in my spare time .
How are your English and computer skills ?
I have passed the CET - 4 and 6 . As far as computer is concerned I can use the computer for word processing .
Okay . Mr . Liu , we'll inform you of the results within a week .
The style of the exterior is just what I ' Ve been looking for !
The exterior is only half of the story . The interior is incredible .
This home is gorgeous on the inside !
Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new .
The wall colors totally suit the style of this house .
Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen .
I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops .
The master suite is the best . Let ' s go look at that next .
There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room .
I know that you like this house , but let ' s take a look at the others before you make up your mind .
Oh , right . You ' re busy with that contract . Maybe you could join us later ?
Unfortunately , I just can ' t make it this time . I have to go straight home . It ' s my second wedding anniversary , and we ' re supposed to be having a big dinner Susan would kill me if I missed it .
Happy anniversary ! Sorry you won ' t be there . Maybe some other time ?
Yeah , maybe . Thanks , anyway . Hope you guys have a great time !
Where is your domicile place ?
My domicile place is Hebes Province .
I ' m just coming for that .
She kept bothering me .
She ' s your sister . What she asked was only duck soup for you . Why can ' t you be good to her ?
But I am her brother , not her servant .
You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ?
Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t
Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ?
Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff .
Well , welcome to the team .
It ' s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know .
Wow ! Your calligraphy is very beautiful . It was worth the wait !
Thank you . Today I'm writing a kind of poem called a Chinese couplet .
What does it say ?
This is an especially famous one . It says " May the passing days bring you health and longevity . May this season of renewal find you basked in riches . "
That's very nice . Is it for sale ?
No . I never sell my artwork .
Really ? Then what do you do with it ?
I give it away . Here , this one is for you .
Wow ! Really ? Are you sure ? Now I'll have a lucky year !
Remember , real luck must be created ( by ) yourself , and then it cannot be given or taken away ...
Do you have any carry-on luggage ?
No .
Put your luggage on the scale , please . Oh , your luggage is overweight .
How much is the excess baggage part charge ?
Twenty-two dollars
Here you are .
This is your voucher , and you can get your luggage back on this . Have a good trip !
Thank you !
If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude .
Yes , it is annoying .
That ' s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
What was so bad about it ?
Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ' t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
Well , we have 6 for each room .
Yes , but 4 of them are broken . Can you send someone here ?
OK sir , please wait a minute .
Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .
yes , I am the guy ...
what a bummer ! You set me up ?
let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ...
Oh , Would you do me a favor ?
Yes ?
Please mail this letter for me on your way to the store .
Sure . Do you want it to be registered ?
Yes , I think so . There are some pictures in it . It would be a great pity if they were lost .
Yes , I will be glad to mail your letter .
Thanks .
you are welcome .
Can I try this one on ?
Sure , go ahead .
The color is too bright . For my age , I would prefer a lighter color .
I know . I know . I'm really sorry . I lost my bag .
I'll call the lost and found office .
I didn't think of it . Thank you . And I do apologize for being late .
Let's see , 30NT is about ... almost a dollar US . What ? ! How about these pineapples ?
They're 250NT each , but they're not edible . They're only used for worship .
Hmm , 250NT is ... 8 dollars ? ! ! And you can't even eat them ? You're crazy !
Wait ! Don't go just yet . These bananas are pretty cheap--only 35NT for this bunch .
Now that's more like it ! Bananas have lots of potassium , too !
They're also good for your digestion ! Would you like some kiwis , too ?
Are they from Taiwan ?
They're imported from New Zealand . Four for 50NT . Nine for a hundred .
OK . I'll take four kiwis .
Hmm ... let me look . Yes , it says it's a pet-friendly building .
That's great . That means I can bring my cat , Mr . Twinkles . Where is the apartment located ?
It says it's located in the suburbs .
Could you please get him on the phone ?
Sure . Wait a minute .
I agree . But I think that we can handle the problem by making a few major changes . I ' d appreciate it if you would give me a chance .
All right , Maria . I ' ll give you until tomorrow at 4:00 to produce a satisfactory piece of work , but otherwise , you ' ll have to re-do it .
What kind of juice do you prefer , sir ?
Breakfast juice and please make my coffee very strong .
Yes , sir . American breakfast with fried eggs sunny side up . Breakfast juice and black coffee . And my correct , sir ?
Yes , that ' s right .
Is there anything else , sir ?
No , that ' s all .
Good morning , sir . I ' Ve got breakfast your ordered .
Just put it on the table please .
Do you need anything else , sir ?
No , thanks . Oh , yes , could I have some juice for the mini bar ?
What kind of juice do you like sir ?
Tomato or orange juice , please .
Yes , sir . I ' ll get them for you right away . Would you please sign this bill first ? Thank you , sir .
And after church they come here for lunch ?
Yup , a big potluck buffet . And then-notice there are no children around ?
Yeah , what's up with that ?
The kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . Hide away , Yi-jun !
The traffic is not very heavy on this high way , is it ? So I ' m sure we ' ll make it .
No , but we ' Ve got a hurry . It will be the rush hour soon .
Don ' t worry . There ' s plenty of time yet .
But it ' s Friday today . This road is always jam packed during the weekend , isn ' t it ?
Right .
Do you feel tired ?
Yes , my whole body feels weak . And I really feel terrible .
I'm sorry to hear that . I'll have to examine you .
Ok , go ahead .
Open your mouth and show me your tongue . Say ah ... You have a bad cold . So you must stay in bed for a week .
Where did you learn it ?
At school . And I'm still learning it now .
How long have you been learning it ?
About three years .
Can you speak any other languages ?
I'm afraid not .
What's your question ?
How many hours behind the wheel do I need ?
What do you need to take it for ?
I'm trying to get my license .
You need six hours .
Can I do all six hours in one day ?
You have to do it in three days .
That's all I have to do ?
That's everything .
Well , that's a relief .
Oh , I see . You have two choices here you can either redeem or renew .
I think I'll redeem , if that's not a problem .
No problem at all , Mr Waterstone . Any preference as to how you want the money ?
Anything you like , but not too many large notes . It's useful to have smaller notes .
Here we go , Mr Waterstone . Here's your money and your interest note .
Yes , yes . Everything's fine . Thank you very much , Becky .
Let me check . Yes , we have .
May I try it on ?
Sure . Let me help you .
Yes , I think So .
Good . I was thinking that I ' d like to invite you to watch a movie . I can meet you at the cinema gate .
What ' s the time ?
Six thirty , tonight .
Oh , I ' m sorry I can ' t because I have to do some housework . You can ask Jenny to go with you
All right . Maybe next time I can go with you . Bye !
Good bye !
Thanks . Have you got the L / C number ?
It's NX567822100007 .
Hang on a tick and I'll check for you . I'm sorry ; we have no record of that arriving .
OK , thanks for checking . Could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ?
No problem . I'll be in touch as soon as it comes in .
Thank you .
Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ?
Remember when we were kids ? Theaters wouldn't let kids in to PG moves without a parent .
I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed .
Now with video rentals it's all a personal matter .
Yea , I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either .
Now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't .
Thank you , sir . Sorry to trouble you .
Not at all , Susan . Just tell him to leave it with my secretary when he ' s finished with it
Red .
Here you are . It ' s very attractive .
May I try it on ?
Go ahead .
Is there a mirror around here ?
Right over there .
Does it suit me ?
Yes , you look very nice .
How much is it ?
We're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax .
That's quite reasonable .
He's a year older than Keith , but he looks younger .
How's your father ?
He's fine . He retired last week . It's a turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .
He can spend more time with his grandchildren .
Oh , I don't think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea !
How do you want to spend your old age ?
In the same way , probably .
Did you win ?
Of course .
He is short , well-built , and he ' s got light blond hair .
Is there anything else ?
He has a mustache , if I remember correctly , and a light complexion .
How old is he ?
He is in his late thirties .
Well . I shouldn ' t have any trouble recognizing him . What time does his flight arrive ?
At 2 thirty .
Do you have your library card ?
I sure do .
There is a wait for the computers .
That ' s all right .
You need to print your name on this list .
Okay . Now what ?
Once a computer is available , I will let you know .
How am I supposed to log on to the computer ?
All you do is type in the number on the back of your card .
That ' s it ? Thank you very much .
I don't think so . You have to wait for about 10 minutes .
That's all right .
Can I help you ?
I would actually like to view the apartment for rent today .
I ' m sorry , but you won ' t be able to view it today .
Why not ?
You have to make an appointment first .
Oh , okay . Can I do that right now ?
Is this Friday okay ?
Is 6 o ' clock Friday evening okay ?
Yes , I will schedule you for that time .
Thank you very much . See you then .
Would you like cheese on that ?
No , thank you .
Would you like a drink ?
Let me have a soda .
What kind of soda would you like ?
May I have a Sprite , please ?
Sure , no problem .
I would also like a bag of chips .
Will that be all ?
That's everything .
How may I help you ?
Could you cancel a check for me ?
What ' s the problem ?
I wrote the check out for way too much .
How much ?
I wrote the check out for $ 150 .
What were you supposed to write it out for ?
I was supposed to write the check out for $ 100 .
I ' ll just cancel it for you right now .
That ' s great . You ' re a lifesaver .
Wow , that sounds great ! Where are you going ?
I think I will start off in Paris . Then I ' m going to take the train to Nice and then go on to Milan .
Oh that will be lovely . You ' ll be able to do lots of shopping I expect .
Oh yes and try lots of new food too .
Great . Make sure you buy me a souvenir !
Oh , don ' t worry , I will !
It looks like the shipping company did this .
We'd better take it up with them , in that case .
My roommate always brings a lot of friends from off-campus . They stay in the room until midnight , singing and talking , drinking and playing cards while I have no place for study . I even don't have the quietness to sleep .
Did you ever talk to him about it ?
This dish taste terrific . Would you like to try a little ? It is a little hot , but very good .
I like hot food , especially Sichuan cuisine .
Would you like another beer ?
I'll have another cup of beer insist . I know I don't like to drink alone , especially there are someone sitting there next to me .
Come on , it's the weekend . Let's taste and enjoy this meal . Cheers !
Bottom's up , and you're right . This meal is incredible . I wish I had known this restaurant before . Thanks for bringing me here . I know I'll be back agile soon .
When did the trouble start ?
I was sick most of the night .
It sounds like you are coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature .
Have I got a high fever ?
Yes , thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ?
Yes , I have .
Now , let me have a look at you . I'd like to listen to your chest . Now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it Cough , now again . I want to examine your throat , too . Open wide , say ' Ah - - '
Aaaaahh , aaaaahh .
Yes , it does look a bit sore . Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests .
All right , thanks .
The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection .
What shall I do today ?
I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . Take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . Drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . Here's the prescription .
You've come to the right store . We've got a beautiful and wide selection of earrings for you to choose from .
I saw a pair of earrings outside your window . Can you show them to me ?
Do you mean the exquisite pearl earrings ?
Exactly . How much do you want for them ?
They're only three thousand yuan .
What is this setting made of ?
Well , it's specially made of a platinum alloy , sir , and the lustre will never fade out .
I'II take them . Please wrap them up tor me and give me the receipt .
You've made an excellent choice , sir .
I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles .
I can think of better things to dream about ...
Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away .
That's crazy .
Almost two years ? Your English is very good .
Thank you . But there's still a lot for me to learn .
yeah . It's hard to believe that it's been ten years since graduation . It feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas .
how time flies . But hey , how are things going with you ?
oh , where to start ? There have been ups and downs . I'm still trying to find my place in this world . It's only recently that I've been able to start settling down . How about you ? You still with Jenn
yeah , Jenny and I got married right after graduation . It was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . I was supporting us both while she continued her studies . But now things are getting better
oh , that sounds wonderful . I have always known you two would make it . I hope I can keep in better contact with you guys . I don't want us to drift apart again .
definitely ! Actually , we just moved into a new place . There's a house-warming party this Saturday , if you are free ? I know Jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party .
sounds great ! I'll be there .
No , I was just about to get up . What's up , Carl ?
Listen , I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus ?
B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown .
Oh , you mean Canal Street ?
That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown .
Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ?
At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ?
I cannot get hold of her yet .
See you around , Carl .
See you later .
Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day .
They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest .
I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project .
You'd better pay more attention to your health .
I will , thanks for your concern .
You're welcome .
I'm leaving him a message taped to my computer screen .
What does it say ? Do you think he'll see it ?
He'll see it . It says , I like sweets . Meet me at two thirty in the parking lot .
Can I spy on you guys from the window ?
No . But I'll fill you in later . Right now I have to find Vince .
I often do , but I ' m worried about the responses from other people .
you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion .
I ' m worried that what I say will not make sense .
we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking .
that ' s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ?
that ' s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle .
I didn ' t realize that speaking in class could be so easy .
the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ' t be sure how .
You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ?
I have not sir . But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here .
Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well .
Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list .
How many people are on the waiting list right now ?
Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list . And you are number 176 .
I'm very well , thank you . How are you ?
Very well too , thank you very much . Isn ' t it a lovely day ?
Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot .
Yes .
What's the weather like in your country ?
Mm ... It's quite warm now .
Where do you live ?
In London . Where do you live ?
Here . Near this school .
How far is it from our hotel ?
It's about 5 kilometers .
If we start early , do we have some time for Yuanmingyuan ?
I think so . We can go there in the afternoon if you like .
Yeah , those classics from the great writers .
But I find Japanese ones better .
Sure , why not ?
What else would you like to add ? We highly recommend caterpillar fungus .
Caterpillar fungus ? ! What the heck is that ?
It ' s a special kind of Chinese herb . It ' s good for you !
I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better .
Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards .
It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case .
It's already half past eleven . You have school tomorrow . You'll sleepy all tomorrow , if you don't sleep well tonight .
I know . But I promise I won't be sleepy tomorrow . I work really hard .
Don't you have the exams coming up soon ? I'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those .
Oh , I nearly forgot the exams .
You do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . Am I right ?
Yeah , I guess so . Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow .
An excellent idea . Work now and play later .
I know you're right . School is more important than TV . Can I watch one more show , then go to bed .
No , now it's bedtime .
Well , this is my baggage claim tag . Can you get my baggage now ?
OK , here you are .
Thanks a lot .
Mm , you do look rather pale . Let me take your temperature . Would you put the thermometer under your arm , please ? Now , let me listen to your pulse . Mm , do you feel weak ?
Yes , I never seem to have any energy .
I'll give you a blood test . Would you roll up your sleeve ? Just as I thought . You're anemic . You'd better pay more attention to your diet . Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . And don't stay up late working . Try to get more rest .
Thank you .
Just a moment . I'll check to see if she is at her desk . May I tell her who is calling ?
This is Bill Burton from Milford Insurance , I'm calling in regards to our meeting next Tuesday .
Thank you , Mr . Burton . Can you please hold for a moment ? I'll check to see if she is available .
No problem .
I'm sorry , Ms . Jenkins is away from her desk . She has already left for lunch . Would you like to leave a message for her ?
Mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system .
What does that mean exactly ?
Well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers .
What other sources of energy do you use ?
We don't use any fossil fuels . Most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants . We're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power .
I plan to , but what day is the election ?
You should know that .
Can you just tell me ?
The election is this Tuesday .
Are you serious ?
I ' m not kidding .
It ' s a good thing I asked you .
That should ' Ve been something you knew already .
I couldn ' t remember .
Whatever . Just make sure you go vote .
same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months .
my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .
true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .
definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .
the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken .
is that inflation ?
inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation .
has the government taken some measures to curb it ?
yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .
but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .
you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .
how ?
for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense .
sounds a good idea .
I've been talking to WebTracker . I'm thinking of jumping ship .
What ? Are you serious ? You'd defect to our archrival ! ?
Keep your voice down . We'll talk more later . Right now I need to see Vince .
We definitely have to talk , Zina . And watch your back . Elvin is still mad about his nose .
OK , but don't tell anyone what I said .
I prefer one facing the sea . Besides , it should have a shower .
Sorry , right now we can only have you a room without shower .
Well , that's fine .
Well you can ' t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I ' m the banker .
Banker ?
Yes ...
Can I have my $ 200 please ?
Sure . Here you are , $ 200 , Thank you , please come again ! Now it ' s my turn to roll the dice .
A :: Very well . How's Mrs Clinton ?
Not bad , But she's as busy as before .
Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth .
Why do you want to be an insurance agent ?
I care about people and I know the importance of insurance .
Do you have any work experience in promotion ?
Yes , I do . I have worked as a salesman for P & G Company Ltd .
Do people respond well to you ?
Yes , I'm good with people .
Let ' s put it down for 1:15 on Thursday . We ' ll definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .
Fine . I ' ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on Thursday .
I'm a stranger here . How can I get there , please ?
Just walk down the road for a few minutes , and you'll find it on your right .
Thank you very much .
Why ?
The task is tough .
You'd look before you leap .
Thanks for your concern .
Totally agree . What is your solution ?
Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy .
You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
But I don ' t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .
I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
This way , please . Here they are . They're all handmade .
Oh , they look nice . May I try that black one on ?
Of course . The fitting room is right over there .
Do you have a medium in the same color ? This one is a little tight .
l'm sorry . All the black of that size are sold out . Would you like a red one ?
OK . Let me try it on . What do you think ?
Oh , that suits you very well . Besides it is believed in China that the red color brings happiness and good luck .
Really ? I'II take it and I'm leaving here tomorrow . Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you get it in ?
Our pleasure . Please fill out this form , leaving your address and telephone number .
Thanks . How much would that come to ?
Let me see ...
Hold on , please . Let me check it for you . Yes , you're right . You will keep it for 3 days .
Well , now I want to change the date from 24th to 28th .
OK , that shall be arranged .
I must apologize . I'll buy you a new one tomorrow .
No , please don't . I couldn't let you do that .
I can't figure out how to turn them on .
Do you have some quarters ?
I didn't know I needed change .
The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar .
Where do I put the change ?
The quarters go into the slot . You have to push the slot in , and the machine will turn on .
Is that everything that I have to do ?
That's all there is .
I appreciate you helping me with this .
If you need anything else , just let me know .
Hi . I understand that you have a house for sale , haven ' t you ?
Yes .
I ' d like to know more about it .
Can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o ' clock ?
OK . I will be there .
Thank you for calling . Goodbye .
Bye .
Have you a pattern in your mind ?
Well , maybe sneakers or rubber shoes .
Is there any special brand you would like ?
Could I have look at that pair of canvas shoes ? They look nice .
Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too .
I don't know . I just need to try it once . I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight .
You should try swimming then . It helps you to keep fit .
I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films .
Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary .
Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them .
It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one .
But it's really exciting .
Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one .
Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror .
Yep .
I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind .
Maybe . After all , I am grown up now .
I think it ' s important to do now . We can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital .
But it won ' t be on my birthday .
But your health is more important . Believe me !
But you could have saved money .
From a sweet ma ? ! It's not worth it . Plus , I'd happily pay more for these things I bought !
F . Y . I . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you're done ...
Ha ! I'm just warming up ! Please take me there now !
I am sorry . If you have here more than 24 hours between connecting flights , we can't check your luggage through London .
Well , maybe I can put them in the airport storage there .
That's right . It's over there .
We have many kinds of different purpose . I wonder whom you are buying for ?
My son . He is two years old .
I see , sir . This one is very good .
Is it ?
You may rest assured . It sells well .
May I have a look at the introduction ?
Certainly . Here it is .
Professor , I am Kalina from your morning literature class .
Yes , how can I help you ?
I ran my car into a tree yesterday and need to miss a few days of school .
Oh , my God ! I hope you are all right .
I have a concussion , but I will be OK .
How much school will you miss ?
I only need to take this week off .
I appreciate you calling and telling me that you won ' t be in class . See you next week !
Lower level employees need not attend . The purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level . In order to get everyone to jell together , we've got to include some fun . That's the reason for the retreat .
She told me that Peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage .
Oh , I see . But I think you are making a fuss . They will make it up . Bet it .
I hear that John's leading a double wife .
It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife .
I did . But they said they won ' t change them .
That ' s terrible . But if they wouldn ' t change them , I know what I would do .
great , let's go !
hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world .
exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ...
yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies !
why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .
are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ?
never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ?
yeah , I think so .
ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great .
wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases .
Come on , it ' s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging .
It ' s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . It gives the room a good atmosphere .
A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart , and it ' s messing up the room .
But it makes the place feel so much like Christmas . I ' d really hate to have to take it down .
But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ' s been there only because we ' Ve been too busy to get rid of it .
I know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away .
But it ' s falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches .
I know , I know . But it reminds me of the great Christmas we just had . All of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted .
Yeah , it was a good Christmas . It won ' t always be this good , but we can ' t make it last longer than it should .
Ok , fine . We need to take down the tree .
I ' ll make a deal with you . We ' ll leave it up until Sunday , and then we ' ll take it down after church .
Well , the wrong information is in my file . I was at a concert Monday night .
Well , your word overrules the file , sir . One moment , please .
I knew you'd see it my way .
Sir , I deleted the $ 10 , but I had to add a $ 2 service charge to your bill .
Am I in the Twilight Zone ? You're charging me for a movie I never saw ?
Please don't blame me , sir . Blame the computer programmer .
This is highway robbery . I've got a good mind to call the police !
If it makes you feel any better , other guests feel the same way .
And would you like an appetizer before your meal ? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup .
I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad .
Can I get you anything to drink ? :
Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea .
Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
Thank you .
But I have been so busy all these days . Well , is there any other ticket available ? I want the next one .
How long will we dock ?
In half an hour . The surface of the lake is calm .
Yes . We come at the right time .
Do you want me to help you ?
Please .
Look . Here are the core classes . Everyone has to take them .
So I don't have to worry about them .
You're catching on ! However , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ...
I'll take home economics .
Good . Now you can pick classes by yourself .
I'm with Hartford public relations . I'd like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services .
How about tomorrow at 11 o'clock ?
What's the problem ?
She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she ' s around .
For example ?
Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .
No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .
My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .
I need help with food .
OK , well , let's coordinate our efforts . Should this party be formal or casual ?
I think it should be casual .
I agree . Next , we have to decide on food . We have a choice of Chinese or Continental Cuisine . Which one should we have ?
I would prefer Chinese food for this party .
Perfect choice . For music , should we have a live band or a DJ ?
I think we should hire a live band .
OK then . Well , I will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on Friday .
Pleased to meet you too , Ms . Pewless . I travel a lot every year on business , but this is my first visit to your country . I must say I have been much impressed by your friendly people .
Thank you for saying so . Have you seen the exhibition halls ? On display are most of our products , such as silk , woolen knitwear , cotton piece goods , and garments .
Oh , yes . I had a look yesterday . I found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I ' Ve gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I ' Ve got some idea of your exports . I ' m interested in your silk blouses .
Our silk is known for its good quality . It is one of our trade - trional exports . Silk blouses are brightly colored and beau - fully designed . They ' Ve met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand .
Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
I found it very disappointing .
She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see .
I wasn't happy with it .
Nothing is to your satisfaction .
I always hit the snooze button , so give me two calls , one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen .
It'll be our pleasure . We'll call you at 7 and then at 7 fifteen .
Oops , cancel that . Change the second call to 7 thirty will you , please ?
No sooner said than done . Can I help you with anything else ?
No , that's about it for now . Thanks .
Okay , sir . Have a pleasant evening .
yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go .
they must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood .
they're also one of the richest couples . They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want .
I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars .
did either one of them win an Oscar this year ?
I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything .
Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?
yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous .
I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .
people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated .
I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .
that's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go .
thank goodness we're not rich and famous !
being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich .
Do you know Chinese better now ?
Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone .
Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere .
I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation .
A shouting match ? You ' re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ' t believe it .
I am not exaggerating at all . I ' m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time .
Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ' t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ' s quite natural to us .
Yes , absolutely true .
I want to know whether you will come to the interview . So have you accepted offers from other companies ?
No , I haven't got one by now . I will go to the interview of yours .
What were you mean duties there ?
I mostly did advertising planning .
What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ?
I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market .
What was the most important thing you have learned at work ?
The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success . If I want to make in marking in advertising industry , I can ' t stop studying and creating .
Fine , just fine . And you ?
Not bad . It really is great to see you again . Where have you been ?
Guangzhou . I've got a cousin there .
All right . I'll get it .
Hello ! We're supposed to be getting back to nature .
Yeah , yeah . Anyway ... I'm packed . Are you ?
I've been packed for a week . All my stuff is in this backpack .
Let me see ... two books ... birdseed ?
That's trail mix !
Same difference . What's this ?
Thank you .
I am sorry to have kept you waiting . Mr . Johns needs a telephone call from you .
Would you bring the message to my room .
I'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment .
Then I'll come down and pick up the message immediately .
OK , we wait for you .
Twenties and some smaller bills , please .
Anything else ?
Yes . Could you tell many balance ? Here's account number .
Do you have some experiences to share with me ? I want to have a try .
You are asking the right person . Here are two very important tips . First , you need to visit no more than one site to find the best products and prices . I can recommend you some online merchants . Second , write your mail address correctly . Otherwise , you can ' t receive your delivery in time .
What about the registration procedure ? Is that complicated ?
Not at all . You just need to provide your name , address , e-mail address , phone number and bank or credit card information . I will help you with that .
It is so nice of you .
Do you need anything ?
I need you to help me .
What can I do for you ?
I am looking for an article in a newspaper .
Did you check the periodicals ?
I didn ' t even bother to think of that .
I ' ll show you where to find your article .
I get lost in this library .
It ' s right this way .
Thanks a lot for your help .
I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one .
Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better .
Don't you think it's too bloody ?
On the contrary , very exciting .
And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
Poor child !
Here is my receipt .
What's wrong with it ?
It's too small for me to wear .
Would you like another bigger one ?
No thanks . I want to have a refund .
OK , here is your money .
Great ! That ' ll be ahead of schedule ! Good work .
Well , as the saying goes -- we aim to please !
Which season do you like best ?
Spring .
How about summer ?
I dislike it most .
Why ?
Because the hottest season is summer in a year .
But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
That's all right , I'm a beginner . I've just learnt how to play .
Look , there's a chessboard . Those two men have already finished playing .
You're a very good player
Not really , but once I won a prize .
So did I . I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners .
My prize was for the best player in the country . Now let's start playing chess seriously .
Exactly .
You need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . You know how I know ?
How ?
Because I won't let it fail .
But what about tomorrow ? What if Stars . com decides to go with WebTracker , and not us ?
Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes will do no good .
No , you can ' t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres .
You'll need to wait a few minutes for the fries . They are still in the fryer .
That's fine .
Your total comes to $ 7 .
Here's a twenty . Could you give me some more napkins ?
Sure . Your cash back is $ 13 . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes .
Thanks .
Oh , that's good news for us .

What else ?
Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal .
Sounds pretty good . What about the charge ?
That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year .
Maybe one month . Just have a try first . Not too tough at the beginning .
Wise decision . You'll find it's totally worth it .
First you must check in at Counter No . 4 .
That one there ?
That's right . Then you will follow the signs to Gate 85 .
Thank you . You ' Ve been very helpful .
What is the qualification needed by the position ?
You must have over 2 years'experience first .
Things are going well for me , Joe .
Want to go see a movie tonight ?
My parents are taking me to dinner tonight .
Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ?
What movie did you want to see ?
There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer .
I was thinking that I would like to see " The Secret Life of Bees . "
Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to !
Actually , uh , I made it myself ...
You did ? Wow ! Where did you learn ...
Sorry , but I've gotta run . Enjoy your food , and ring the service button if you need anything else !
I ' Ve never played Chinese chess before , but I ' Ve seen old men playing it in the street . It looks complicated .
It ' s about as complicated as chess . The basic rule and moves are simple enough , but there are many strategies that players need to learn .
I like playing cards . I ' m pretty good at poker . Do you play cards ?
I ' m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling , like poker . If I did , I ' d lose all my money .
Do you play bridge ?
Yes , I do . It ' s hard to find four players though , so I don ' t play very often . Do you know anyone who plays ? If so , we could set up a game .
I can play quite well . I have a friend who likes playing , but she ' s not very good at it . Shall I invite her to play ?
Sure , I have a friend who play fairly well . We should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game .
I ' ll call my friend now . you call yours .
Yes he ' s in his office .
Oh , I hope he didn't notice me .
Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you .
You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ?
I think he might . You'd better go to his office .
You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic .
Good luck !
Do you have a fever ?
I don't know , but I feel terrible .
Let me examine you . Don't worry . It's nothing serious .
Do you think I should lie in bed ?
Yes , stay in bed and drink a lot of water . Your fever will be gone in a day or two .
OK . Do you think I can play football tomorrow ?
Of course not . You need a good rest .
OK , I'll listen to you .
It is largest pop square in the world . you see that is monument for the people's hero , and the Chairman Mao memorial hall on the south . there is great hall of the people on the west . there are two museums on the east .
What's that ?
That's the Forbidden city on the north of Gate building .
All the sightseeing in china is very attractive and crescive . travelling to China is very worth one . thank you so much for your guides , and I'll miss you .
I have no idea . Maybe you can give me some advice .
I recommend you the white wine . It will wake up your appetite .
That's great , bring me a bottle of that please .
I believe we are all out of food .
Do you know what to get ?
I don't know what we need .
Why don't you go and check the refrigerator ?
I would appreciate it if you would do that for me .
Why don't you just get the basics ?
What do you mean ?
Eggs , milk , bread . Things like that .
Go make that list .
Sure , no problem .
Two years or so .
That is great . Do you have to work the night shift ?
No , in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . I work five days a week .
Do you enjoy work here ?
It is hard to say . But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant . Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy .
Take it easy . I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job .
Luckily not . The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss .
Glad to hear that .
My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L . A . Hank and I will be flying there tonight .
I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ?
Doctors aren't sure yet . But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .
You need a babysitter .
Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight . Maybe even for two nights .
I could have Suzy stay at my place .
I don't want to do that to you , Karen .
Why not ?
Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .
I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston . She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .
I'd like to talk with her . This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .
I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .
I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it . But I'd rather have someone a little older .
I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .
Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .
I'm in such a need of the job that I can't afford any mistakes .
I'm sure you'll pass it .
The bathroom sink is stopped up .
Is the kitchen plumbing messed up also , or just the bathroom plumbing ?
Just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem .
Did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ?
Everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago .
Are you going to be home so I can come by and take a look at the problem ?
I am not sure if I will be home later .
I will be coming by around 10 this morning . If you aren ' t there , I ' ll just use my key .
Oh .
Wait a second . He shoots , he scores !
All right !
Here comes Jordan , though .
Wow , Michael Jordan ' s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch .
Yeah . He ' s older , so he doesn ' t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ' s still amazing .
Which team do you think will win ?
The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has .
My name is Gao Run .
How do you do ? My name is James Green .
Here's my name card .
And here's mine .
It's nice to finally meet you .
And I'm glad to meet you , too .
Good evening , sir . I come to make the bed . Shall I do it now or later ?
Well , since you have come , do it now please ?
That's all . Have a nice stay here .
Thank you . Please get some soap for us .
Just a moment . I will do it right now .
' Please don't enter the bamboo groves . ' We're not allowed to go in .
Then we'd better not go .
OK .
Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .
I see . That ' s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !
That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ' s eight time zones east of Greenwich !
That ' s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ' s like we went back in time !
Oh , oh , Madam , Madam , I'm afraid you have the wrong number .
Isn't this the car store ?
No . It's Mike's Sporting Goods .
Oh , sorry . Do you know the number for a car store , then ?
No . I don't . I suggest you look in the phone book .
I'm sorry to have bothered you .
No problem .
Yes , it's so helpful .
Don ' t worry about it , just ask .
What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes ?
You need to know the type of shoes you want .
Don ' t worry about that . I can point it out in the store .
The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . In girls shoes , the heel can be high or low .
Let me write all that down . I ' m going shopping this afternoon .
Here are $ 40 . Keep the change . That's my tip for you .
Yes , you did .
I apologize , but I didn't realize that I did .
Weren't you taught that yellow means slow down , not speed up ?
I did learn that .
So , then why did you speed up ?
I don't know what to tell you .
I'm going to have to write you a ticket .
I understand .
Here you go . Don't do that again .
The internal factors are composed of human resources , team spirit , innovation spirit and coordination between different departments , etc .
Could I interest you in our store credit card ?
No , thanks . I already have credit cards .
But our credit card saves you 10 percent .
That's a nice discount .
Here . Let me give you an application form .
Thank you , but I'm just browsing today .
Okay . Enjoy your browsing .
May be some other time .
I'd like to start this interview with some questions . Why do you think you are qualified for this position ?
According to your advertisement , you want an experienced software engineer . I think my background meets the requirement of this position .
Then tell me something about your background .
My major was computer science when I was at college , and I am quite familiar with Visual C + + and Java language .
Well , what do you think about the development in computers ?
The developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software . In some regions , the hardware is completely replaced by software . So I think the software industry has a great future .
Have you ever designed any programs concerning network ?
Yes , I have designed some programs for the network with Visual C + + and I have passed the test for programmers - MUSE .
Have you got anything to ask me ?
Yes , can you tell me what's my responsibility in this position ?
Yes , of course . You would be responsible for the development of software products .
I see . This is my advantage .
Good . Have you got any other questions ?
No .
Ok , I will contact you in a week . See you .
Thank you , bye-bye .
I can't see it .
I tend to stick to fruits , vegetables , and chicken .
Those are the only things you eat ?
That's basically what I eat .
Why aren't you eating anything else ?
Well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy .
And the chicken ?
It's really healthy to eat when you bake it .
I guess that does sound a lot healthier .
What's the 14 pounds for ?
That's for the phone calls you made from your room .
Can I pay with traveller's cheques ?
Certainly . May I have your passport , please ?
Here you are .
Could you sign each cheque here for me ?
Sure .
Here are your receipt and your change , sir . Thank you .
Thank you . Goodbye .
Actually I ' m buying a camera for my husband .
Ah , well then I ' d recommend a nice entry-level digital SLR .
Yeah ? Can I take a look at the Sirs you carry ?
Sure thing , follow me . This here is the .
The Canon Eos . Yeah it ' s ok , but I ' m looking for something that performs better in low light , has a better display panel , and longer battery life .
Oh , ah , um the Nikon D60 is a nice option .
Yeah , but what kit lens does this camera come with ? I don ' t want some bulky telephoto lens .
Oh , well this one has the , uh .
Looks to me like an 18-55 mm lens . pretty standard , that will do . Not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything !
So , ahem , can I interest you in any acc ...
Accessories ? Do you carry polarizing filters ?
Polarizing filter um we should ! I ' m sorry , ma ' am . It looks like we ' re sold out .
No you ' re not ! There are some right here !
Oh , well , would you look at that ! Polarizing filters .
Thanks for your help , Ralph !
No problem , ma ' am .
I'm worried that everything will be chaotic !
Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests .
You're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ...
I will . Don't worry !
Tickets ? What tickets ?
Two air tickets .
Air tickets ?
Yes . We will fly to Paris the day after tomorrow .
We ? The day after tomorrow ? What are you talking about ?
Today is June 18 , isn ' t it ?
Yes . So ?
Think about it !
Then it is June 20 the day after tomorrow .
Yes . Think about it carefully .
Oh , come on . Tell me please . Why did you book tickets to Paris ?
Oh , honey ! Don ' t you remember this important day to us ?
Sorry .
It is our 10th wedding anniversary this June 20 .
Our 10th wedding anniversary ?
Of course . You completely forgot it .
Darling . I think you have made a mistake .
I have made a mistake ?
Yes . We married on July 20 ten years ago .
July 20 ? But I think it should be June 20 .
Yes . We had planned to marry on June 20 , but something happened , so we had to put off our wedding day .
Yes . I remember now . We put it off . I did make a mistake . But how shall we deal with the tickets ?
Since you have booked . Then let ' s celebrate our wedding anniversary before hand .
I'll have ham and egg with French fries . What dessert do you want ?
Banana pie .
Where shall we sit ?
How about there ?
Yes , and I also have the runs
I'll give you some tablets that should make you feel better . One moment , please . Here you are . Take these tablets three times a day swallow them with water .
When should I take them ?
Take on after each meal .
How long should I continue taking them ?
Take them for two days . If your symptoms persist for more than two days , you should see a doctor Also , be sure to drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration .
Thank you for your advice .
I got fired .
How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ?
It's a long story . In a word , I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up .
What are you going to do now ?
I am trying to find a job asap . Lily doesn't know yet . I didn't tell her . I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought I went to work as usual .
That's not the way to solve the problem . Did you look in the classified advertisements column ?
Yes , I did . But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in .
Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand .
I just don't know how to bring it up . Well , all right . She has the right to know anyways .
Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will .
One dollar .
How many stops are there ?
Two stops after this one .
Could you please tell me when we get there ?
Sure .
By the way , do I need a transfer again after No . 50 ?
No , a No . 50 will take you right there .
Thank you .
Sorry , sir . It's the sale price .
Well , what about $ 70 with a scarf ?
It's my rock bottom price . Take it or leave it .
If so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks .
Then what ' s your counter-offer ?
This is our counter-offer .
We are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great .
So are we . Our counter-offer is in line with the world market .
How about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ?
Agreed .
Great ! I want a three piece suit , preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool .
Very well sir . Would you like to have some shirts made also ?
Sure . I ' ll also take some silver cuff link and a pair of silk ties .
Very good . Now , if you will accompany me , we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts .
No problem . We'll supply you with an apartment of two bedrooms and a living room .
Really ? Even for such an excellent one ?
Yes , I've brought a list of your recent products with me . We'd like to import some of your latest clothes for the second half of this year . We're ready to place an order with you .
Great ! B , most of the items listed are available this year . I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts , so as to enable our timely delivery .
That sounds good . But I have a proposal now .
What's the proposal ?
Both of our two parties were involved in the discussion previously . Shall we also allow some of our clients to join us ?
Good idea ! In this way , our clients ' needs will be met and disagreements between the two parties avoided .
Sounds like we have the same idea .
Do you have a special restaurant in mind ?
Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food .
OK . I'll be happy to join you .
Right . I enjoy what I'm doing .
Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . See 5PM , ok ?
No problem . See you !
See you !
Yes , I bought a few things .
What did you buy ?
I bought this coat . Do you like it ?
Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ?
At the mall on 5th street .
Was it expensive ?
No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars .
That's cheap .
I know . It was a really good deal .
I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately .
Maybe ... but I don't think so .
Really ? What's the matter ?
I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad .
Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner .
Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already .
I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks !
Some people say that history repeats itself .
What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ?
The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same .
I see . I think I ' d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .
Let me check with a credit manager . A record show your credit reading is quite high . I don't think you have any problems .
What ' s the current interest rate ?
Our monthly interest is 1 . 5 % of the outstanding balance . Would you please fill out the application the form ?
No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?
I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring . He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .
What did you do ?
I didn't do anything . Finally , he left . But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .
Did he leave when you left ?
Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .
What did you do ?
I think they have pretty good programmes . But I'll change it if you really want .
Put it on Channel 5 , OK ?
Oh , I hate Channel 5 . I'd rather just listen to the radio .
Don't make such a fuss . I'm sure you will like today's programme .
What's on today ?
A basketball match between Chinese team and American team .
Really ? I'm interested in it .
It might begin now .
No , but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow .
I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days .
Montreal .
When did you come to Los Angeles ?
We moved here when I was fourteen .
Did you go to school here ?
Well , I went to high school here , but I went to college in Texas .
Did you get a job right after graduation ?
No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France .
When was that ?
Let's see ... That was about six years ago .
I bet that was interesting . What did you do there ?
I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me . How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ?
And I can purchase that here ?
Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us , the Insurance Premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle .
I am dying from the heat .
Turn on the air conditioner .
It doesn't work .
What happened ?
I don't know .
Did you call the repairman ?
Of course .
When is he coming ?
He's busy . He said next week .
No way , if it still has 21 .
They are keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
And what is the most important point ?
You should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .
Oh , yes . How do you do , Miss Wang ? Sit down , please .
Thank you .
What was your major in school ?
I majored in Public Relations .
Have you done any work in this field ?
Yes , after my graduation , I worked in a trade company in Macao for one year .
What section did you work in ?
The export Business Section .
So you must be very familiar with export procedures .
Yes , very much .
That's good .
Didn't I ?
You know you didn't .
Well , I am telling you now .
Yes , but you might have told me before .
I didn't think you would be interested .
You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?
Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .
Oh , you men ! You are all the same .
I can suggest a product called Techne that comes in a lotion or cream .
Which do you prefer ?
Hikers tell me that the cream is best because it stays on longer .
Is there anything else I can do to help with the itching ?
You can take an antihistamine .
Thank you so much for all of the information .
You are welcome . Please feel free to ask me a question any time you need help .
we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec
wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait !
tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ?
perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank .
no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .
we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning .
great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain .
no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week .
Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us .
He's away on a business trip . He won't be back until some time next week .
Is there some way I can get into contact with him ?
The best way to reach him is by cell phone . I'll give you his number .
Thanks . And could I have his e-mail , just in case I can't get him by phone ?
Sure . His cell phone is 09112223 33 . And his e-mail is lower case t , smith--that's one word , at , c , c , w , dot , com , dot , t , w .
Thank you so much . Does he read his e-mails daily ?
Yes . He usually replies immediately .
Great . Thanks again . You've been very helpful .
My pleasure . I hope you get a hold of him .
You see , This time I traveled to the West . When I looked out of the windows of the rain , all the lands that I could see are as dry as a bone .
It is serious .
I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature .
It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ?
Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ?
Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike .
Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city .
Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest .
Well , bring him along too . We ' ll have a great time this weekend .
Thanks , I ' ll ask him .
That give us a good lesson .
All right , could I leave a message ?
Certainly !
Please ask her to call John .
I'm quite outgoing i think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself I think . A friend in need is a friend in deed . The more really close friends I have , the better .
What kind of people do you like to work with ?
People who are honest , dedicated to their work and having integrity .
You forgot all of about it , didn't you ?
I have so much house work to do . I have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends .
How about your husband . Does he help much ?
Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ?
That sucks .
If he wasn't so lazy , I think I wouldn't have any complaints . He mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ?
That's crossing the line .
Oh well . I'll have to live with it . What else can I do ?
I will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem .
Will I be able to read the results on the website and understand them ?
Yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about .
How will I know what the numbers mean ?
You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range .
How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ?
We put all of your test results up in the same place . Just check the dates for what you need .
I see . Have a look at this one . It ' s very cheap because it ' s not very durable .
but it looks good . Let me try it on .
Ok , the mirror is over there .
Yes , Chinese people love drinking tea so much . Some even claim they can't live without tea .
Do you know there are several catagories of Chinese tea ?
Yes , I believe there are green teas , black teas and scented teas . Any Others ?
Well , have you ever heard of Oulong tea and compressed tea ?
Oh , yeah . Oulong tea is good for one's health . isn't it ?
You surely know a lot about Chinese tea .
Sure , I like drinking tea at teahouses .
Oh , so do I .
Why don't we go for one now ?
Great . We can chat while enjoying a cup there .
Let's go !
I studied economics , I am especially interested in the economic development of China .
What course did you like best ?
I like Business Management , and i think it's very useful for the present work .
What do you think is the relationship between the subjects you've taken and the job you are seeking ?
I've taken courses on office administration , reports and correspondence writing . I think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager , because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
Absolutely . By the way , do you sell any traditional Chinese medicine ?
Yes , we have some Chinese medicine for common cold .
I heard Chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure .
It depends . It's true that you can take some for prevention .
OK . Please do so if it is not troublesome .
No trouble at all . May I know your name and room number ?
I'm Du Juan , in Room 312 .
I see . Wait in the room , please .
Thank you for your kindness .
That's reasonable .
You can use quarters , dimes and nickels .
Well , thanks for the compliment anyway !
You're right .
That is right up my alley . You say party and I'm there .
Perfect . It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people .
Will it be an all day event ?
Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library .
That was quick thinking .
Yes , me too . But I'm disappointed .
I was in New York for a wedding .
Exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together .
There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming .
That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games .
Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you .
My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you .
OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool .
Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that .
I try my best to eat only fruits , vegetables , and chicken .
Is that really all that you eat ?
That's basically it .
How do you stick to only those foods ?
Actually , fruits and veggies are really good for you .
Yeah , I know , but what about the chicken ?
I mainly eat baked chicken , because there's not a lot of fat .
That does sound pretty good .
I know it does , and that's because it is .
That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ?
Perhaps one year , I'm not sure .
Well , first you have to turn this switch on .
Silly me .
Now press this button .
Oh , and it's out of paper . Do you have any more ?
Just a second . I'll go get some .
Yeah . Cold milk wakes me up .
Chinese people don't like to eat cold food .
Is that right ?
But I'm open to new things . I'll have a bowl of cereal , too .
With cold milk ?
With cold milk !
Yes , I almost slid too . Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ?
Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped . Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .
Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop .
There . Stop !
How about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? It was painted by a famous Chinese painter in King Dynasty .
Oh , they look just like live cranes .
And what is more , in traditional Chinese thinking , cranes and pine trees symbolize longevity .
She is expecting .
Congratulations to you .
Thank you .
Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married . Remember ?
What do you mean ? We ' re talking now , aren't we ?
Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together .
Yes . I remember . But we never used to argue . You used to think I was wonderful . Where are you going ?
Back to live with my parents . That's something else I used to do before we were married . Remember ?
By the way , I want a large room .
Right now we have a suite for 4 people , do you want to book it ?
Yes , that's what I am looking for . I will take the room for 2 days .
Well , it still hasn ' t gotten here , and my boss is pretty angry about it .
Yes , and I hope that it does .
Why is that ?
I really love how rain clears the air .
Me too . It always smells so fresh after it rains .
Yes , but I love the night air after it rains .
Really ? Why is that ?
Because you can see the stars perfectly .
I really hope it rains today .
Yeah , me too .
Can you hold it for me ?
Here is five dollars .
Here is your change . Please wait for your receipt of the registered mail .
I also want to pack up my package . This is the notes .
Let me see . En .. just a minute . Here it is . I need your signature on this note .
Oh , one more thing , where can I mail this letter ?
Drop it in the mail box mark out of town . at that corner .
Thank you very much .
You ' re welcome .
it takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ' ll probably be about an hour ' s wait .
can I buy stamps here ?
sure . How many would you like ?
I need 30 for my Christmas cards .
are you sending them abroad ?
twenty of them are going abroad to China and America .
do you have any going anywhere in the EU ? If you do , those are less expensive .
no .
ok , here you go . That will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence .
and the bubble wrap ?
that ' s another quid .
thanks a lot . You ' Ve been very helpful .
It ' s at ... gate 14 .
Oh , great ! That ' s at the other end of the terminal !
OK , so here ' s the plan ; When we land , run to gate 14 !
I ' m be right behind ya !
Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it .
Is classical music your favorite ?
Yes . What about you ?
I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .
Pop music doesn't have any depth for me .
Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it .
Did you always like pop music .
I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music .
I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life .
oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play .
Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy .
That bad egg , who took the low road since he was a boy .
I think I must report to the cops .
Ok .
How do you do ?
How do you do ?
It's kind of you to meet me at the airport .
Welcome to Beijing . Is this your first time in China ?
No , I have visited China several times , but it's my first visit to Beijing and I think it's a great honor to be invited to your beautiful city .
It's our pleasure to have you here . I hope you will have a pleasant stay here .
Thank you . I'm sure I will have a wonderful time here .
I don ' t try to lead people . I ' d rather cooperate with everybody , and get the job done by working together .
Do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English ?
Yes , in most circumstances .
Are you available for travel ?
Yes , I like travelling . I am young , and unmarried . It ' s no problem for me to travel frequently .
Yes , I have .
What ' s on ?
Paris in the Spring .
Oh , I ' Ve already seen it . I saw it on television last year . It ' s an old film , but it ' s very good .
Paris is a beautiful city . I have never been there . Have you ever been there , Ken ?
Yes , I have . I was there in April .
Paris in the spring , eh ?
It was spring , but the weather was awful . It rained all the time .
Just like dear old London !
I ' ll be here for approximately three weeks . See , here ' s my return ticket for the twenty-sixth of March .
And , who is sponsoring your trip ?
My brother , here , this is an invitation letter from him . I will stay with him and his family in their home .
Alright , tell me about the ties you have to your home country .
Well , I own a house . actually , I ' m leaving my dog there with my neighbors . I have a car at home , and oh , my job ! I ' m employed by Tornal as an engineer . Actually , I only have three weeks ' vacation , so I have to go back to work at the end of March .
And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ?
Well , I do have assets in my country . like I said , I own a house , and see , here ' s a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance .
I ' m sorry , sir , we cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time , instead , you are granted a resident visa ! Congratulations , you are the millionth person to apply for a visa ! You win ! Congratulations !
Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ?
I didn't know you were a vegetarian !
I'm not , I am a vegan .
A what ?
A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood .
Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough !
It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult .
I can type 80 words a minute , basically no mistake , and can take dictation in English at 120 words per minute .
That would be too late .
Maybe the situation is too urgent .
Yes , I think I should have jumped in any case .
Yes . It's nice to meet you too . Are you a new student too ?
No . I'm a sophomore . I take it you are a new student ?
Yeah . It's pretty exciting to be here .
Have fun while it lasts . The excitement wears off real quick . Especially after you see how much homework you get . Where are you from ?
I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here .
I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea .
Why were you in Japan ?
My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures .
That's pretty cool .
I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents .
Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around .
Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class .
Ok .
Not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu .
Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now .
Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ?
You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down .
Ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting .
Zach , what's that on your arm ?
I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing .
It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ?
Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .
I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go .
Shouldn't we make an appointment first ?
We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse .
Whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting !
Sure . I'll give you the next size up . That one is small , right ?
Yes . Also , I'm not so sure about the color .
Well . It doesn't go with your skirt . I think the color itself is fine though .
Thank you .
Well , he should pay you back . It ' s only fair .
Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ' t have got angry .
Did you lend him a lot of money ?
Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back .
Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ' s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ?
No , we didn ' t . I guess you ' re right . We should patch things up .
Of course you should . You wouldn ' t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ?
Well , I won't keep you then . It was very nice of you to come to see me .
It has been a pleasure . Goodbye .
Goodbye . Thank you again for coming .
Oh , I don ' t know ... it ' s hard to find the right nanny . You have to consider her previous work experience , the responsibilities you give her , and how she interacts with the kids . I would love to have
I think you should definitely consider it ! This way you won ' t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ' ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . I can refer you this great
Oh , that ' s great . Thanks Grace . Can you give me her number ? I ' ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow . Maybe this way I won ' t be so tired every day , and Dan and I might even get to go
I just want to talk to you about the tests that I want to run .
Can ' t you just tell me now ?
I don ' t know anything for certain . We always do a double check if there is a question .
I want to see you right away .
You can come in this afternoon . If you are feeling too stressed , feel free to bring a friend along .
I know for sure that something is wrong !
Don ' t worry about a thing ; we are just taking a second look and talking .
Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said .
It must be interesting to study English .
Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss . Parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ?
Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
Sure . I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores .
Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ?
That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www . taobao . com or www . ebay . com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place .
Is the service charged ?
No . it's free .
Really . I'll get a computer at once .
China .
What is the score ?
China beat Brazil three to zero .
Wonderful .
Would you like to ask me anything ?
What do you feel about gay marriage ?
I think everyone has the right to love who they want .
Would you legalize gay marriage ?
Yes , I would .
Many people won ' t like that .
I ' m sure they won ' t , but that ' s my view on gay marriage .
I really like you .
I really appreciate that .
I'm sorry , sir . What seems to be the trouble ?
I believe you have charged me twice for the same thing . Look , the figure of 6 . 5 dollar appears here , then again here .
I'll just go and check it for you , sir .
Dad , I don't want to talk about it now .
Honey , if you don't want to go to cram school , you should tell me the reason why .
I'm sorry , dad . But I would rather stay at school than go to cram school .
He asked me how long it took me to learn English .
But , you were born and raised in California !
Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes .
What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ?
You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice .
So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ?
I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it .
Are you sure he really got the message ?
Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English .
That's hilarious ! What did he say ?
He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good .
I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again .
OK , a taxi will be there by 9:30 .
What are your rates ?
It is RIB 10 yuan initially and 2 yuan for each kilometer .
I have a lot of luggage . Will those fit in the taxi ?
Take it easy . I'll send a larger to pick you up .
Thank you very much .
I ' m sorry . I have no idea . I haven ' t seen that for ages .
Yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ?
I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique . I didn't know I could get it cheaper somewhere else .
Of course ! Everything at Helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn't you shop around ?
I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive .
What's the color of her eyes ?
Dark blue .
He stays up untill all hours of the night , and he never lifts a finger to help .
Have you talk to him about it ?
Not yet , but I have to soon . He's eating me out of house and home . I caught him reading the fridge again last night
Ahahah , Maybe that will help you lose weight .
This is no laughing matter , Nick .
Sorry Paul . I couldn't help it . So why doesn't he give you a hand ?
He watch the tob too much . Now really I don't know . But I can't handle this much longer .
Well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , OK ?
Well , I have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics . what you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors .
Yes , I really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school .
That's a problem .
Yes , it was quite a long flight . I'm glad to finally be here .
I was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight ?
I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper .
OK . What about going to the movies on Friday night ?
What were you planning on seeing ?
I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer .
How about " The Secret Life of Bees " ?
That's a chick flick !
Thank you , Paul .
By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday .
Good , happy birthday to you !
Not so soon . It ' s not my birthday today . Well , you ' ll come , won ' t you ?
Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me .
My pleasure .
It is the basement of that red building in front of the tower with big bells .
Where is the Computer Center ?
The Computer Center is on the first floor of the library .
Where is the library ?
The library is next to the Adminstration Building . The Adminstration Building is over there near the school ' s main entrance . There are school maps for free in the lobby of the Admin .
Thank you . I will go get one .
Sure . Glad to be of service . By the way , my name is Mike Sullivan . You will see me around a lot . I am running for President of the Student Government .
Well , hi ! My name is Eve Markowski . I am glad to meet you . With your friendly smile and helpful attitude . I am sure you will win .
Thanks you for the encouragement .
You are welcome . I ' d better go . Goodbye .
Have a good day . Bye-Bye !
She went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident .
You know how hard I've tried to give up drinking ? I ' d be lost without you . I won ' t let you go anyway .
No , thanks . I ' Ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine .
Haha , I could never do that . I ' d be a zombie if I didn ' t have my morning coffee fix . Let ' s get down to business then .
Yes . I ' Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . The demand for phone cameras is growing , and Pear has been falling behind in the market .
That ' s great ! I ' m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . Is Pear still interested in having those ?
No , we ' re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
Surely . Let ' s get started by drafting a new contract .
In a way that's right . But the Vikings travelled there long beforeColumbus . And what about the Red Indians ?
All right . Ask me a question now .
Who invented the electric light bulb ?
That's easy . It was invented by Edison .
Correct . Now for a harder question . Who will be the first men on Mars ?
I can't answer that . But I think Mars will be visited by men before theed of this century .
Ask me a question now .
All right . What is the nearest planet to the sun ?
That's easy . It's .. er . Venus . NO . Pluto . No . Wait a minute . It's Anthe tip of my tongue . Oh dear , what is the nearest planet to the sun ?
You can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees .
The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play !
Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men .
Well , I really wanted to see the football game .
Football game ? Ok , and you know what comes on next ?
I believe there ' s a sitcom .
Are you interested in watching it ?
Let me look in the TV Guide first .
Oh , I am sorry . What's on Channel 2 at 10 pm ?
If I remember correctly , it's a quiz show .
Do you want to watch it ?
Let's watch it together .
Good .
Let's have a look at the menu . Oh , there isn't a menu . Do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ?
Yes , of course . Excuse me . Could you possibly let us see your menu ? Oh . They haven't got one either .
A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ?
A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle .
But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you .
We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies .
I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free .
Don ' t lose your reason . Go to find him and talk with him .
I don't want to sit there and watch them torturing the animals .
Oh , come on , they give them treat too . Oh , look , that little monkey is so cute .
Cute ? Hope so .
Oh , it is coming to us , come on , Ben , get a banana to it .
Me ? No way , keep him away from me , please .
Why are you acting so strange today ?
I've said that I've got a problem with the circus . I'm not kidding .
That's weird !
Oh , I see . So , you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities .
No , no . I've got plenty left .
Now I'm confused again ! What is the problem ?
What am I going to do about souvenirs ?
Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs !
Yes , I've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs .
Sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items , and as a guest you get a discount .
Please ! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs .
I understand completely , sir . Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment .
That'd be wonderful , Peter . But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning .
I'm sorry I was such a grouch . It must've been the weather . When it rains I get depressed .
Forget it . I'll see you at 11:30 am .
I can't understand him anyway .
Quite a lot . All them one afternoon ?
Yes , it is not easy .
It is OK with me . I enjoy being busy and learning new things .
I meet too many jerks .
I agree .
This city is full of jerks .
Rude people are everywhere .
But what can you do ?
You can yell at them .
And they will yell back at you .
Yelling doesn't do any good .
No . The best thing to do is just stay home .
There are websites that can hook you up with a roommate .
How much do apartments cost around here ?
It depends on what you want . Do you want a one - or two-bedroom apartment ?
I just need a one-bedroom apartment .
That will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month .
Would you come with me to look at apartments ?
I would be happy to look at apartments with you .
Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas .
Great , so what happens now ?
Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it .
If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .
What ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
Let's hope so .
The 17th will be fine .
And what date will you be returning ?
Hmm , I guess on the 28th .
Okay , you're booked on American Airlines flight 710 , departing JFK at 6
Sounds good . Thanks a lot .
OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night .
Please make sure to fasten your seat belt . We are to take off .
Yes , I have already booked a room .
Yes , I like to make new friends .
What do you usually do with them ?
We like to get together , chat and enjoy beautiful music .
What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ?
Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful .
That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day .
But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope .
We'd better prepare for the worst .
There have been charges made on my debit card that I didn ' t make .
Do you have the statement for your card ?
Here it is .
What are the charges you ' re referring to ?
The last four charges on the page .
I ' m afraid we ' re going to have to investigate these charges .
How long will an investigation take ?
I honestly don ' t know , but we will freeze payment on these charges .
That sounds absolutely fantastic .
What about this one ? It's a very nice 3 - piece suit .
That looks great . Do you have ties here ?
Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ?
Sure . Do you have my number ?
Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this .
No problem . I'll wait for your call .
Only three days ?
That's the company policy .
What happens if I use up my sick days before the end of the year ? If I ' m sick an extra day or two , will my pay be deducted ?
Yes . That's the company policy .
It was the same as the last place I worked at . I was hoping you ' d be different .
Congratulations . How lucky you are !
Thank you . I ' m leaving tomorrow morning .
I ' m sure you ' ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country .
I ' m sure I will .
Have a nice journey , Lily .
Thank you , David .
Well , you know , those styles or colors don ' t suit me .
What style do you want ?
I want to buy a V-neck checked sweater , and it should be tight .
Oh , I see . How about the color ?
Quiet color .
I know a shop selling this kind of sweaters .
Really ? Let ' s go there .
Uh , yes , okay . Tell him John Suzuki called . That's S-U-Z-U-K-I .
Yes .
From Video TV .
Yes , Video TV .
Tell him I telephoned . I'd like to see him about the videotapes . Can he call me this afternoon ?
Yes , Of course . What's your telephone number ?
It's , area code 413 , 447-9626 .
That is 413-447-9662 ?
No , that's 447-9626 .
Oh , I'm sorry , 447-9626 .
Yes , that's right . Extension 162 .
Extension 162 . Okay , Mr . Suzuki . I'll give him the message .
Thank you . Good-bye .
Good-bye .
I like him . He's good for her .
You're right . He sure is .
High hells , please . I want to wear them in formal situations .
Oh , yes . I remember .
Sure , why not ?
That is the pump you are in front of .
Is it expensive ?
It is the most expensive .
Well , I don't want it then . Can I move to another pump ?
Yes , I can give you regular unleaded . But you have to back up the car a little .
Give me regular unleaded then . I will back up . Can you wash my windows for me ?
I'm sorry , sir . This is not a full service gas station . I will help you fill the gas , but we don't wash windows here .
Really ? Well , I guess I have to get used to it .
He is five years older than me , He got married last Sunday . My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age .
It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging .
Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ?
Yes , they say I would get a big sum .
Have you discussed it with your wife ?
Yes , she leaves it to me .
As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary .
I have to think about it .
Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too .
I agree , I had lunch there last week .
Excellent ! That sounds like a plan .
Sounds great , I'd very much like to accept your invitation , thanks , when ?
Around six pm .
Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating .
No . thank you . I can handle it , but thanks for the offer .
Ok , I will see you then .
Great , have a good day , thanks again for the offer .
Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ?
Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me !
Why ? I don ' t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
They don ' t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do .
All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us .
A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due .
Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible .
I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries .
So do I .
What kind are you thinking of getting ?
I want to get some pie .
What kind of pie do you want ?
I have no idea .
Do you want to know what kind of pie I like ?
Sure , what kind do you like ?
I love apple pie .
Oh , I love apple pie too .
There you go . Problem solved .
It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly .
Model of computers aren't compatible ?
Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities .
Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable .
But by then , the technology will be outdated .
True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge .
That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable .
This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product .
I guess you get what you pay for .
Yes . Copywriters are supposed to design and write articles for the advertising company .
What time you suspect back them ?
Sorry , I am not sure , can I take a message ?
No , thanks . I'll call back later .
That's fine . please call again later .
Ok , thank you . Goodbye .
I didn't know that .
I thought you knew .
I honestly didn't know .
The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .
That's good to hear .
Will you go and visit them ?
Of course I will .
I just wanted to give you the good news .
Thanks for letting me know .
Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ' s why the parking lot was flooded .
I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
Nah , not too flashy .
Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ' t it hideous ?
I guess .
Are you even listening ? I ' m trying to have a conversation with you .
And I ' m trying to watch the game , but you ' re yapping on about your new clothes !
Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon !
Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ' s the third quarter and you ' Ve been blabbering on since the first !
Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
Oh no you didn ' t . You didn ' t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ' t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game !
It should be due in at 7:30 a . m . tomorrow .
How much is the ticket ?
It's 86 coach and 175 berths
One berth , please .
I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment .
What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ?
The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior .
How do you organize and plan for major projects ?
I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario . Then , I set a timetable that's realistic . What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react .
Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure .
I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks . The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me . Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed .
How do you manage your time in a typical day ?
I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value . The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week .
Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion .
I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings .
I start work at three .
And when do you get home at night ?
I get home pretty late , around midnight .
So what do you do , exactly ?
I'm a TV announcer . Don't you recognize me ? I do the weather report on KNT !
Gee , I'm sorry . I don't watch TV .
How can you do that ?
Yes , Mother , but my arm is longer .
How wonderful it would be if I had such smiles !
That sounds like a good idea .
I know a very interesting place .
Oh , do you ? Good .
Oh , I know a place where you might like to eat .
Is it close by ?
It's down a block on the right ; can I show you the way ?
OK , I'd love the company .
This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it .
May I have your name ?
That's Lincoln .
I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ...
What is it ?
Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others .
That makes you feel uncomfortable ?
Yeah . we never do that in a public office .
Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy .
I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding .
Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus .
Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ?
Yeah .
Oh , I'm shocked .
Hum . Maybe it will be better . The most important thing is that I can have a day to relax after a week's work .
I see . We will go the day after tomorrow .
By the way , what kind of stores do we need to go ?
I want to buy some clothes in clothing store . When we are going back , go to the butcher's shop and buy some chicken .
Let ' s also go to the jewelry store to buy a crystal necklace . I want to buy one for you as your birthday present .
Thank you , darling .
Let ' s go over there and get some milk , a couple dozen eggs and some orange juice .
Let's get frozen juice . It is really good . We ' Ve got enough food . Let ' s go over to the check-out stand .
OK . But just let me pick up a bottle of cooking wine and oil as we go by .
Because I have given him up as a bad job . Our relation has been over .
Yes , twice last week .
Are you sure ? I thought I said it was my mother .
I don't think so . But it could've been .
Well . You can trust me this time . My sister is definitely sick . I'm just coming from the hospital . They say she might even die .
I don't buy your story . Try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ?
I'll do my best .
Just try to be a little more punctual in the future .
I'm working on it . Really !
Is it waterproof ?
Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am .
Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ?
Well , surfing , scuba diving ...
And the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average , for that particular industry , for the first two quarters of the year .
Well , as far as I can tell , we qualify .
Of course we will need proof , originals and duplicate of everything . As soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed .
It's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more .
Oh , really ? are there any snakes ?
Snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .
That's terrific . I can't wait to check it out .
Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?
Why not ? it's so cool .
But it will pose a risk to your health .
Pardon ?
I mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems .
Well , I didn't realize that .
I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .
Oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .
Yes , good luck , Maria .
A draft beer please .
OK . Here you are .
Could I have some fruit ?
Of course . Wait for a moment , please .
Oh , that's how you see it .
No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?
Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like .
Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?
Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered .
What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste .
Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag .
I've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement .
That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear .
What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password .
It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough .
I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping .
Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .
That's a good idea .
That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it .
Certainly .
Yes , it's Yao Lan . Room 406 .
And how many pieces did you have ?
Two suitcases and a handbag . The suitcases are blue and the shoulder bag is red .
Is there a name tag attached to them ?
Yes , there is .
We're very sorry for the delay . I'll check immediately and call you back .
Actually , the company will provide you with all of these supplies . So , you can leave this very thick notebook at home .
I know . But it is my lucky charm . I carry it all the time .
Suit yourself . Don ' t forget to set the alarm clock .
do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ?
no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions .
it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America .
religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal .
what do you think about abortion ?
I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself .
do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?
I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children .
why not ? It's their children , too .
that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand .
that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter .
Any form of picture I . D . will do .
Mmmm ... a photo I . D . I have my New Jersey driver ' s license . Is that ok ?
That will do . What an interesting picture ! How old is it ?
Actually it wad taken just last year , but I had a shaved head and a beard . Can you still recognize me ?
Barely . Will you be checking any luggage today ?
Yes , One suitcase . I also have a carry-on bag .
Ok . Mr . Lee , you ' re all set . Your flight leaves from gate 10 . Boarding begins at 10:30
With everything , with everybody , with all this !
A good suggestion for you . You need a holiday .
It wasn't always like this , you know .
What do you mean ?
Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives .
You need a holiday . That's what's the matter .
Certainly , perhaps .
No .
Our sniffer dog seems to disagree . Do you mind if we look in your suitcase ?
Not at all . Go right ahead .
What ' s this sir ?
It ' s traditional Chinese Medicine . I mix it with hot water like tea . Sorry . I forgot about it .
What are these red things sir ?
Oh no ! I forgot about those too ! Those are Chinese sausages for my Aunt Lily .
I ' m sorry sir , but you can ' t take any of this into the country . We will also have to check your carry-on . Please step this way . Don ' t ' be nervous ; we ' ll just look through it briefly and then
Here you go .
These books were due two weeks ago .
Yeah . I totally forgot they were due .
You will need to pay late fees on these books .
How much are the late fees ?
The fee is 25 cents every day .
I have to pay 25 cents a day ?
And that ' s for each book that is late .
That shouldn ' t be a problem .
Sure . And I'd like you to get some cold medicine for me when you go to the doctor's .
Yes . Tell him Mr . Cook called and ask him to return my call soon as he gets back .
All right , Mr . Cook . I'll have Mr . Baker call you back as soon as he gets here .
We expect the usher girl to be good-looking , no less than 165 centimeters high , and love smiling .
I don't think so . I'll create further achievement in the future .
Have you received any honors ?
Yes . I got the title of " Advance Worker " in 2006 .
Do you have any publications ?
Yes . I wrote a thesis entitled " On Interpersonal Relations in the Socialist Market Economy " and it was published in China Daily .
Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .
Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
What do you drink ?
Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
Do you know a lot about cars ?
A little bit . I'll take a look if you want me to .
Please . Thank you so much for stopping .
Yeah , she's hot . Radiator's leaking . Looks like you were running her pretty hard .
That must have been just before I got the speeding ticket .
Did you have an accident recently ... Hey , wait a second ! I know this car !
You do ?
I ran into it a couple of weeks ago . What do you know ? Name's Hal .
I'm Akimbo . Nice to meet you , I guess .
Boy , I'm sure sorry about your car . Hey , Akimbo , I wonder if you'd like to make a deal ?
What kind of deal ?
I'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car .
You don't want your insurance company to pay for it ?
I'd rather not . They'll raise my rates . It'll cost me more in the long run .
If you give me cash , do you care if I don't fix the car ?
Hell , I don't care . Just don'T submit a report to your insurancecompany .
It's a deal , Hal . Thanks again for stopping to help . And thanks for smashing my car !
The food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone .
I see . You simply can't blame the server for this .
Yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district .
That's true .
Anyway , how was your such , Catherine ?
It was good . I brought lunch from home today .
You did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America .
Well , I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy .
I guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat .
Yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , don't you ?
You bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America .
Well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places .
Seriously ?
Yeah , it's hard to believe but true .
Not bad .
Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening . Would you like to come with me ?
Sure . Thank you very much .
Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty . OK ?
Ok , see you .
See you .
Yes , smoking or non-smoking ?
We'd like a non-smoking table , please .
Come with me , please .
It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ?
Yeah . I think I can find it .
You're back already . That sure was quick .
That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me .
Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . Anyway . He said it was too close to closing time .
Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway .
Okay , let's go !
You're kidding .
No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years .
Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul .
Well . Good for him .
I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself .
Does your husband feel the same ?
Yes . He is very understanding and supportive .
I'm looking for a position in which I can utilize my experience .
Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position ?
I am more interested in a full-time position . However , I would also consider a part-time position .
Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ?
I advised customers on financial matters . After I consulted the customer , I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis .
What is your greatest strength ?
I am an excellent communicator . People trust me and come to me for advice . One afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
What is your greatest weakness ?
I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . However , I began setting time-limits for myself .
Why do you want to work for our company ?
After following your firm's progress for the last 3 years , I am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and I would like to be a part of that team .
When can you begin ?
Immediately .
Sour-peppery soup .
Which condiment do you use for ?
I'll use ginger , garlic scallion , hot pepper and vinegar .
Very good , need I help you ?
No , don't need , I can do myself .
Thanks . I can watch TV now .
But you must cook that dinner next time .
Okay , I'll do it next time .
Wow ! Congratulations !
Please call me Jack . Have a seat , please .
Thank you .
Oh , breaktime flies .
Come on , baby . It ' s time now .
Mam , another minute , could I ?
Hurry up , little boy .
My mother-in - law . She retired last year .
You really are lucky !
Yeah , I know .
You inform the people in charge and let them reserve dinning tables for guests .
This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months . She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend .
Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ?
Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat .
That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ?
It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy .
I guess it does seem logical . I'll have to check it out !
Slow down . What are you talking about ?
It's about a girl . No , an angel ! I'm going to the coffee shop where she works right now .
Oh ...
It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
Sorry , love .
What are you looking for now ?
My cigarettes .
Well , they ' re not here . They are in the dustbin .
In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ?
You need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid .
Can I send it in now ?
You should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due . If it hasn ' t been , we will still accept it .
Can I mail it in early next time so it isn ' t late ?
Actually , you cannot mail it in early , as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date .
Will my paycheck come right away now ?
Your check will arrive a little late .
I believe it happened last night .
Where was the break-in ?
It happened at my house .
Was anything stolen ?
I haven't checked yet .
Why do you think there was a break-in ?
My front window was broken .
We'll send a squad car shortly .
I'd appreciate that .
The dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks .
You ' re getting married in three weeks . So that should be ok . So , you ' Ve prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel-everything .
Yes . We ' Ve taken care of all of that . We decided not to get married in a church though . Neither of us is very religious .
Which hotel will the reception be held at ?
The palace hotel they ' re taking care of the catering , including the wedding cake . I ' m sure they ' ll do a good job .
Oh , yes . It ' s and excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
Yes . It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . It gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people .
I think you make the right decision .
Yes , I think so . But how do you prove to me that you are more capable ?
Maybe you can hire me on trial . If I'm not qualified for the job , you can let me go .
Good idea .
Don't worry . There are all kinds of things in the center .
That's much more convenient . We don't even have to bring the flavorings .
Then I advise you to buy the LAY cleansing milk .
Can you tell me more ?
Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ...
Is everything ready now ?
Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive .
Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .
Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet .
It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ' t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available .
Thank you .
My pleasure .
It's free of charge .
Thanks so much .
I bid on a Chanel watch at the last minute , and got it sixty percent off !
Oh ... I'm such a newbie . But at least I'm sure I'll get that tennis racket .
Don't count on it , Babe . eBay is always full of surprises .
Well ... guess how low the bidding starts on the tennis racket ?
But now you are rich .
And we have some squabbles on some boring things .
This is ordinary marriage life .
Well , can you be more specific ? There are a lot of websites about that .
Yes , I want to know about the battle of Gettysburg .
O . K . Well , go to google . com , and type in " Battle of Gettysburg . "
Oh wow , there are a lot of sites .
Here , try this one . It ' s a good site about Gettysburg .
Thanks .
For detailed information , however , you should read a history book .
Thanks . If I ' m interested , I ' ll go to the library .
You'll be staying at Holiday Inn . It's a three-star hotel with two restaurants and a swimming pool .
Great . What types of things will we do at Lushun Falls ?
The second day you take a four-hour city tour . In the afternoon you go on the famous boat cruise under the falls .
Yes , sir . I apologize for that . Here ' s the file you were looking for , Mr . Emory .
How about we go eat in the cafeteria ?
I never bought food from the cafeteria .
You haven't ? They have a lot of good stuff .
What do they have ?
They sell everything .
Well , I want Chinese food .
I've gotten chow mein from there before .
I guess we can eat there then .
Trust me , the food isn't half bad .
Working in the gym is a very good way for losing weight . What else do you have ?
Here's the swimming pool . It's open from 10 a . m . to 11 p . m . There are also massage rooms here .
That's wonderful ! I like swimming .
I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides .
what do you usually write about ?
at first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my family an
that's interesting . How often do you write a blog ?
it's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks .
got it . Are you still updating your blog ?
sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like .
good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months .
Sure . I strongly advise you to buy a bottle of perfume and a lighter .
Fine . They look nice . I will take both of them .
May I have a look at your passport , please ?
It's just the job I've been searching for .
I really don ' t know . I don ' t think we ' ll win many gold medals , but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones .
What do you think our chance are in other events .
In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ' ll do well in those same events .
We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice .
I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total .
You are very optimistic !
Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them .
You mean that you can them .
That's right . I can see them in my dreams .
They come to the earth ?
No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space .
Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ?
OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings .
That means that you talk to them ? In which language ?
Of course in English , they learn English on Mars too .
Wow . Sounds fantastic !
I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring .
Well , congratulations . When is the big date ?
In June .
Did you have the watch before getting the ring ?
Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch .
You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous .
Thank you so much .
What kind of watch is it ?
It's a Tag Heer .
If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ?
This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .
That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for .
Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .
He ' s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ' s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ' s fine for someone his age .
Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?
The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
How are they at swimming ?
They ' re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ' s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ' re not very fast , but that ' s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
I ' d be afraid to jump from that height !
I think that these kinds haven ' t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher .
It seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further .
Hmm . In Carrefour , Clinique will be promoting their visible skin renewed cream .
How much is it ?
180 yuan , and you can get a free 8 piece gift package .
What's included in the gift package ?
Some black mascara , moisturizing orion , eye cream crystal lipstick , a two color eye shadow pack , styling hairspray , and a cosmetics bag .
Sounds not bad .
$ 300 .
We will take the trip . Could you give us a pamphlet ?
Here you are .
Really ? What did you get one for ?
I parked in the red zone .
Why did you do that ?
I needed to get something really quick .
Where did you park at ?
At my apartment building .
Don't you have your own parking spot ?
I needed to be fast .
That was very lazy of you .
What What features do they offer ?
Well , if you just take a look here , see , with our chequing account , you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee , and our savings account has a higher interest rate , but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars .
I see , well , I think I ' m more interested in a chequing account . I like to have easy access to my money .
Alright , then , with this chequing account you ' ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . Will you require overdraft protection ? There is an extra fee for that .
No , that won ' t be necessary .
In that case , I ' ll get you to fill out this paperwork . I ' ll need your social insurance number , and two pieces of government ID . If you could just sign here , and here , and here . we ' ll be all set . Would you like to make a deposit today ?
Yes , I ' d like to deposit one billion dollars .
Where will we sleep , then ?
In the van .
What about other expenses ?
Let ' s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ' t spend much . Come on . Don ' t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ' t we ?
Maybe you ' re right . When do you plan to go ?
The sooner the better ! I can ' t wait !
Oh , I don ' t know where we ' re going yet .
As long as we ' re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time .
Let ' s go to Chicago . We can have lunch in Chinatown . Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field !
You have such good ideas !
No , thanks .
No , just a few minutes .
If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun .
So , what is most important to you in a job ? Do you need job security or professional growth and a chance to advance ?
I need job security .
Would you be able to relocate ?
I am open to relocating .
What are your annual salary requirements ?
I need at least 75,000 per year .
I ' ll keep that in mind . Thank you for coming in today . We ' ll be in touch .
No . it ' s only five minutes walk . you can ' t miss it .
Thanks a lot
You are welcome
Walk that way for about four blocks . The hotel's about two blocks north of there .
Thanks a lot .
Not at all .
I went to Paris .
Right .
You'd better cool yourself down first .
Sure , that sounds good .
Great ! Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ?
No , make the second one with ham , pineapple and green peppers . Oh , and make it thin crust .
Okay , thin crust . Your total is $ 21 . 50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ' s free !
Perfect . Thank you . Bye ..
wait ! ! I need your address !
Not to me , I wouldn't be caught dead in that .
I love that kind of stuff .
Yeah , you seem to like those styles .
Sure do . I get a kick out of looking punk .
This one looks really expensive though .
I don't care how much it costs . I'm rolling in it .
Lucky you ! I can't buy anything else . I'm flat broke .
I got a replace my party outfit , I trashed it last week .
Why did you drag me into this ? I've spent a week salary .
Are you on the level ? You're the one who called me , remember ?
Just joking , Tonia . I've got some wonderful clothes . Let's go and have a close look at your outfit .
Neither am I . So a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area ?
I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
How much do you think the rent will be ?
I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
No , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating .
That's great !
Mitsubishi , HP , IBM and many other famous corporations .
Does the 7th floor belong to our company too ?
Yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building .
It ' s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ?
Yes , at the end of the hall .
Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there ?
No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital .
Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ?
Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus .
Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 .
But number 13 buses leave from the center of town . You ' ll have to walk two miles to catch one .
Okay ...
I ' Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people .
What ? Why ? I mean , we ' Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ' re happy together , aren ' t we ?
That ' s just it , I ' m not happy anymore , Tim . It ' s not you , it ' s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
So , what are you saying ? You ' re breaking up with me because I ' m perfect ?
Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ' ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ' d only hurt you , I know I ' d only make you cry .
Baby , come on . Don ' t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ' t leave me .
I can ' t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ' m only doing this for you . I don ' t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do .
Laura ...
Here are your keys . I ' ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ' m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ' ll always love you . Goodbye .
Oh , I'm sorry about that .
Never mind being sorry , what are you going to do about it ?
Don't worry , we'll soon fix them .
Good , I hope you'll make sure that it won't happen again .
I'll certainly look into that .
Thank you . Goodbye .
You ' re right , sir . I apologize . I ' ll get those files for you now .
Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values .
In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies .
I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time .
Yes , I know .
When you become a permanent employee , you will have the insurances . You will get monthly pay and will be on eight-hour / day work shift .
Wait , will I have five insurances and one fund ?
Yes . You can also enjoy legal holidays and year-end bonus .
It sounds great !
If you need to work overtime , you will get twice the usual salary as overtime pay .
OK .
You have read the relevant terms of the contract . Do you have other questions ?
How long will the induction training be ?
About two weeks .
I see .
If you don't have other questions , just sign here .
OK .
You have to try at least .
OK . Thanks a lot .
That's nothing .
Yes , it has been a long time since we have seen you .
Mary , can I get Josh or you something to drink ?
Oh no , thank you . We aren't all that thirsty .
How about a little snack then ?
No , thank you , we just ate lunch a little while ago .
Well then , how is your family ?
Everyone is doing great . My sister finally had her baby .
I enjoy the various characters and the plot .
Well . I like the Thom Birds best .
Is it very interesting ?
Sure . I like the writer's language , too .
If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book .
Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
That's a good idea . Let's go !
I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it . What did you think of it ?
Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ?
Mmm . That's what I thought too . I really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . And I always enjoy watching Pierce Brosnan .
Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ?
Not as much as last time , actually . What's the name of the American actor who was in the supporting role ?
Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . Did you like him ?
Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together , don't you think ?
I don't know . I think the woman was better . She provided a good love interest . Lucky James Bond !
Yes !
OK , OK !
Now , I'd like to get things under way . The main topic on today's agenda is the development of a U . S . sales strategy for the new EBB . I'd like to hear all of your ideas , Mr . Wall , you seem in top form today . Could you start the ball rolling ?
Uh , oh , sure . Well , I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising .
Well , that's kind of obvious .
Give me a break , Mr Yang .
Uh , let's keep this going , shall we ?
No I don't But l do Taijiquan or Shadow boxing . People everywhere in China usually do Taijiquan early in the morning . It can help people keep fit . It has a history of over three hundred years .
Is it easy to learn ?
Yes . it is I can teach you if you like .
Thank you . I can teach you how to bowl .
Right . Let's help each other .
you ' re right . We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up areas .
so , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ?
ok . You haven ' t seen my company car , have you ?
no . let me take a look ... it ' s longer than my car .
I think it ' s over five meters long . I can ' t remember exactly . It has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour .
wow ! That ' s fast ! I don ' t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway .
we can ' t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit .
Could you tell me the origin of the two festivals ?
OK . The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan . On that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river .
Why do people eat rice cakes on that day ?
In order to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body .
It sounds so moving .
Just a minute please . I ' ll make a call to the HR office . Yes , they confirm your appointment . Please come in . it is on the 3rd floor , room 3106 . You can take the right elevator as the left on is in maintenance today .
Thank you very much .
You ' re welcome .
I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day .
Is it really worth paying for ?
I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter .
If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
Actually , I'd like a booth by the window if that's possible .
Certainly . How about this one ?
This will be fine , thanks .
( Handing her a menu ) Your waiter will be here in a minute to take your order .
Thank you .
It's important to do proper exercises .
You're right . Too much or too little won't do any good .
The trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
Sounds reasonable .
We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
And fruits !
Surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .
I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
Yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can also help one to keep sound physical health .
I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .
You bet it !
Oh , yes . I remember it clearly . Is there anything wrong with it ?
I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel .
Oh , how awful ! Let me have a look , I'm terribly sorry . It was most thoughtless of me . Would you excuse me , please ?
Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes .
It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ?
All right . Thank you .
Just a minute , please . I won't be long . I'm sure this one is perfect . You may examine it carefully .
Oh , yes , it is . I'll take this one .
I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you .
Well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing .
I don ' t know anything about it . Soccer isn ' t as popular in my country as it is here .
That ' s all right . We ' ll teach you .
Is it anything like American football ?
Not very much . It ' s something like hockey , except that you use a big ball and no stick .
I ' ll come down and watch you play some day , and see what it ' s like .
Good idea . I think you ' ll like it if you give it a chance .
The parades are usually military ones , but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs . What do you do on national day in your country ?
We don ' t have a national day .
Really ? That ' s unusual .
I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don ' t .
Actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . In the evening , many people watch special TV shows which celebrate national day .
Could you ask her to call me back when she gets in ?
Sure . What ' s your number , please .
519 367 8901 .
Thanks . And your name is Tony , right ?
Yes . I ' m Tony . Thank you very much .
You ' re welcome . Bye .
Bye .
If I don't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ?
Certainly . No one who evades tax can escape from their detection . They ' ll check your income through computers . You'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . If you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined .
I just watched a movie and I'm scared .
What did you watch ?
I saw the Sixth Sense . I didn't know it was going to be so scary .
I remember that . It was a great movie . But it was definitely scary .
If you're not busy , do you want to come over ? I'm afraid to be alone .
Sure . I can come over . What should we do ?
How about if we watch a comedy . I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense .
Ok . I'll get ready and leave . I'll see you in about 20 minutes .
Hurry , ok . It's dark out .
Don't worry , nothings going to happen . I'll be there real soon .
Ok . See you soon .
You know , healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag .
The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins .
Have you ever tried it ? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ?
It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day .
It may take less time , but I don't know about easier . Yuck .
Thank you . You are so considerate .
Push the red button on the mike to turn it on .
OK . This key is too high for me .
I think it's a piece of cake for you .
OK . Let me have a try ...
Well done ! I hope I can sing as well as you one day .
Thank you . I'm sure you will .
I hope so . Thank you for saying so .
It ' s not really an occasion , it ' s more like I ' m sorry .
Very well . This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
I think I ' m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ?
Mmm , well this is our I ' m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
I don ' t think that ' s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better !
I ' m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ?
Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .
Get out of my store , you jerk !
That ' s out of the question .
Please .
Not a chance .
Not even for an hour ?
Sorry , it ' s impossible .
Do you think I believe the story like that ?
But it's true .
How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ?
That's coincident .
Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time .
I promise I will .
You'd better .
About how much will it cost ?
It will cost you $ 10 .
By the way , what's the time ?
You can see the time on the meter . I have radio time , you know .
It's a quarter to 12 . Could you please drive a little faster ?
Certainly .
You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where .
I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies .
But you must take the design and quality into consideration . You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with .
I agree that yours are of the top .
Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ?
To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help .
Impossible . How about 5 % off ?
Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable .
Ar , Yes . There ' s a big cavity .
Can you fill it ?
I ' m afraid not . The tooth is too far gone . it'll have to be taken out .
Then I might as well have it done now .
you ' d better wait , the gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days .
Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see .
I believe it'll be very expensive .
what would you rather have , samosas or poppadoms ?
I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .
well , let's get a plate of those then .
sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ?
I think I might have a dahl .
what's in a dahl ?
it's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .
that sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
ok . How about some lamb kebabs ?
that's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ?
I think I'll have a beer .
ok , shall I flag down the waitress ?
I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round .
you're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me !
what would you do without me ?
What kinds of currency do you change ?
We can change only three kinds of currency , USD , Japanese Yen and HK Dollar in our savings office .
Could you tell me what the exchange rate for USD is today ?
The buying rate is 826 . 44 yuan for 100 dollars .
I want to change some Us dollars to cover my expense here .
Please go to Counter No . 2 , the foreign exchange counter . It's over there .
Thank you .
But he still does not come back .
Maybe he is on the way home now .
Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time .
I'm very glad to hear that .
Come here , let me introduce some friends to you .
Ye , I hope so . well . Take it easy .
You too .
Yes . Do you know where it is ?
No , Madam . I don't think I do .
It's the 11th Avenue , Park Street .
Oh , yes . I know where it is .
Let me just make sure . You want to withdraw one thousand dollars ?
That's right .
The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up .
It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public .
Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio .
I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio .
Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line .
Aw , Mom-you're such a drag .
You say that now , Lily , but you'll thank me later . I'm your mom , and mother knows best .
He's checking bags . He ' s an official in the customs .
No appetite , always unaged and I can ' t sleep well .
Did you lose any weight ?
YES . I ' Ve lost quite a few pounds since last month .
when was the last time you have track up ?
About two month ago .
Let me take your blood pressure . You look anilic . Well , Mr . Brown . I ' m happy to say it ' s nothing serious . You just a little run down from overwork .
What am I suppose to do ?
I think you ' ll needs just vacation . Try to get out doors more . I ' ll be sure if you get more rest .
Thank you , doctor . I ' ll do what you say .
Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ?
I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves .
You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different .
It depends on traffic and distance , but it is reasonable .
Do the drivers speak English ?
Some are better than others . But , you shouldn't have a problem .
Are they safe ?
For the most part , yes . If you don't feel comfortable with it , then it is best not to take one at night .
Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic ?
He must have just got online for the first time last week . He still thinks it's some kind of new toy .
Congratulations !
Of course it does ! They tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house . I think most of the times they are just scam artists .
Well , historically it is a practice that many cultures share . Reading the tarot cards , in the east they would even read tea leaves ! I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes .
All superstitious nonsense ! I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks .
Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ?
But they're just ads .
Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends .
Thank you .
The park will close soon . We Should better go in right now .
Really ?
Yes , let's go in .
It is a new park , isn't it ?
Yes , how do you know ?
I guessed it .
Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well .
Oh , how wonderful !
Hi , Mr . Sandals . I'm Michelle , at your service . When do you need the room ?
My plans are to be there April 14th to the 17th .
We have new room rates , sir . Will that be acceptable to you ?
Well , it depends on the price , of course . What is it ?
It's $ 308 a night .
I have no problem with that .
Great ! Would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking ?
Definitely nonsmoking . I can't handle that smell .
Nonsmoking . Now , is a queen-size bed okay ?
No problem .
Great , Mr . Sandals . Your reservation is confirmed . Now all I need is your phone number .
Of course ! It's area code 626-555-1739 .
Thank you so much , Mr . Sandals . We look forward to seeing you !
He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him .
Me too .
Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .
Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?
Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited .
He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .
And the host announced that he won it all !
A glass of Qingdao beer .
Yes , sir . I'll bring it over . Have you decided what you'd like , sir ?
Will you make some recommendation ?
Quite good , I think . I came here by bus , and it took me about 15 minutes .
Oh , yes . How old are you ?
Twenty .
Hum , still a student ?
Yes , I'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics .
What subjects are you studying ?
English , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy .
Have you had any working experience .
Well , I worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays .
What do you like to do in your spare time ?
I like sports very much . Besides that , I also like working on a computer in my spare time .
How are your English and computer skills ?
I have passed the CET - 4 and 6 . As far as computer is concerned I can use the computer for word processing .
Okay . Mr . Liu , we'll inform you of the results within a week .
The exterior is only half of the story . The interior is incredible .
This home is gorgeous on the inside !
Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new .
The wall colors totally suit the style of this house .
Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen .
I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops .
The master suite is the best . Let ' s go look at that next .
There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room .
I know that you like this house , but let ' s take a look at the others before you make up your mind .
Unfortunately , I just can ' t make it this time . I have to go straight home . It ' s my second wedding anniversary , and we ' re supposed to be having a big dinner Susan would kill me if I missed it .
Happy anniversary ! Sorry you won ' t be there . Maybe some other time ?
Yeah , maybe . Thanks , anyway . Hope you guys have a great time !
My domicile place is Hebes Province .
She kept bothering me .
She ' s your sister . What she asked was only duck soup for you . Why can ' t you be good to her ?
But I am her brother , not her servant .
Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t
Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ?
Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff .
Well , welcome to the team .
Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know .
Thank you . Today I'm writing a kind of poem called a Chinese couplet .
What does it say ?
This is an especially famous one . It says " May the passing days bring you health and longevity . May this season of renewal find you basked in riches . "
That's very nice . Is it for sale ?
No . I never sell my artwork .
Really ? Then what do you do with it ?
I give it away . Here , this one is for you .
Wow ! Really ? Are you sure ? Now I'll have a lucky year !
Remember , real luck must be created ( by ) yourself , and then it cannot be given or taken away ...
No .
Put your luggage on the scale , please . Oh , your luggage is overweight .
How much is the excess baggage part charge ?
Twenty-two dollars
Here you are .
This is your voucher , and you can get your luggage back on this . Have a good trip !
Thank you !
Yes , it is annoying .
What was so bad about it ?
Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ' t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
Yes , but 4 of them are broken . Can you send someone here ?
OK sir , please wait a minute .
yes , I am the guy ...
what a bummer ! You set me up ?
let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ...
Yes ?
Please mail this letter for me on your way to the store .
Sure . Do you want it to be registered ?
Yes , I think so . There are some pictures in it . It would be a great pity if they were lost .
Yes , I will be glad to mail your letter .
Thanks .
you are welcome .
Sure , go ahead .
The color is too bright . For my age , I would prefer a lighter color .
I'll call the lost and found office .
I didn't think of it . Thank you . And I do apologize for being late .
They're 250NT each , but they're not edible . They're only used for worship .
Hmm , 250NT is ... 8 dollars ? ! ! And you can't even eat them ? You're crazy !
Wait ! Don't go just yet . These bananas are pretty cheap--only 35NT for this bunch .
Now that's more like it ! Bananas have lots of potassium , too !
They're also good for your digestion ! Would you like some kiwis , too ?
Are they from Taiwan ?
They're imported from New Zealand . Four for 50NT . Nine for a hundred .
OK . I'll take four kiwis .
That's great . That means I can bring my cat , Mr . Twinkles . Where is the apartment located ?
It says it's located in the suburbs .
Sure . Wait a minute .
All right , Maria . I ' ll give you until tomorrow at 4:00 to produce a satisfactory piece of work , but otherwise , you ' ll have to re-do it .
Breakfast juice and please make my coffee very strong .
Yes , sir . American breakfast with fried eggs sunny side up . Breakfast juice and black coffee . And my correct , sir ?
Yes , that ' s right .
Is there anything else , sir ?
No , that ' s all .
Good morning , sir . I ' Ve got breakfast your ordered .
Just put it on the table please .
Do you need anything else , sir ?
No , thanks . Oh , yes , could I have some juice for the mini bar ?
What kind of juice do you like sir ?
Tomato or orange juice , please .
Yes , sir . I ' ll get them for you right away . Would you please sign this bill first ? Thank you , sir .
Yup , a big potluck buffet . And then-notice there are no children around ?
Yeah , what's up with that ?
The kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . Hide away , Yi-jun !
No , but we ' Ve got a hurry . It will be the rush hour soon .
Don ' t worry . There ' s plenty of time yet .
But it ' s Friday today . This road is always jam packed during the weekend , isn ' t it ?
Right .
Yes , my whole body feels weak . And I really feel terrible .
I'm sorry to hear that . I'll have to examine you .
Ok , go ahead .
Open your mouth and show me your tongue . Say ah ... You have a bad cold . So you must stay in bed for a week .
At school . And I'm still learning it now .
How long have you been learning it ?
About three years .
Can you speak any other languages ?
I'm afraid not .
How many hours behind the wheel do I need ?
What do you need to take it for ?
I'm trying to get my license .
You need six hours .
Can I do all six hours in one day ?
You have to do it in three days .
That's all I have to do ?
That's everything .
Well , that's a relief .
I think I'll redeem , if that's not a problem .
No problem at all , Mr Waterstone . Any preference as to how you want the money ?
Anything you like , but not too many large notes . It's useful to have smaller notes .
Here we go , Mr Waterstone . Here's your money and your interest note .
Yes , yes . Everything's fine . Thank you very much , Becky .
May I try it on ?
Sure . Let me help you .
Good . I was thinking that I ' d like to invite you to watch a movie . I can meet you at the cinema gate .
What ' s the time ?
Six thirty , tonight .
Oh , I ' m sorry I can ' t because I have to do some housework . You can ask Jenny to go with you
All right . Maybe next time I can go with you . Bye !
Good bye !
It's NX567822100007 .
Hang on a tick and I'll check for you . I'm sorry ; we have no record of that arriving .
OK , thanks for checking . Could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ?
No problem . I'll be in touch as soon as it comes in .
Remember when we were kids ? Theaters wouldn't let kids in to PG moves without a parent .
I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed .
Now with video rentals it's all a personal matter .
Yea , I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either .
Now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't .
Not at all , Susan . Just tell him to leave it with my secretary when he ' s finished with it
Here you are . It ' s very attractive .
May I try it on ?
Go ahead .
Is there a mirror around here ?
Right over there .
Does it suit me ?
Yes , you look very nice .
How much is it ?
We're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax .
That's quite reasonable .
How's your father ?
He's fine . He retired last week . It's a turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .
He can spend more time with his grandchildren .
Oh , I don't think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea !
How do you want to spend your old age ?
In the same way , probably .
Of course .
Is there anything else ?
He has a mustache , if I remember correctly , and a light complexion .
How old is he ?
He is in his late thirties .
Well . I shouldn ' t have any trouble recognizing him . What time does his flight arrive ?
At 2 thirty .
I sure do .
There is a wait for the computers .
That ' s all right .
You need to print your name on this list .
Okay . Now what ?
Once a computer is available , I will let you know .
How am I supposed to log on to the computer ?
All you do is type in the number on the back of your card .
That ' s it ? Thank you very much .
That's all right .
I would actually like to view the apartment for rent today .
I ' m sorry , but you won ' t be able to view it today .
Why not ?
You have to make an appointment first .
Oh , okay . Can I do that right now ?
Is this Friday okay ?
Is 6 o ' clock Friday evening okay ?
Yes , I will schedule you for that time .
Thank you very much . See you then .
No , thank you .
Would you like a drink ?
Let me have a soda .
What kind of soda would you like ?
May I have a Sprite , please ?
Sure , no problem .
I would also like a bag of chips .
Will that be all ?
That's everything .
Could you cancel a check for me ?
What ' s the problem ?
I wrote the check out for way too much .
How much ?
I wrote the check out for $ 150 .
What were you supposed to write it out for ?
I was supposed to write the check out for $ 100 .
I ' ll just cancel it for you right now .
That ' s great . You ' re a lifesaver .
I think I will start off in Paris . Then I ' m going to take the train to Nice and then go on to Milan .
Oh that will be lovely . You ' ll be able to do lots of shopping I expect .
Oh yes and try lots of new food too .
Great . Make sure you buy me a souvenir !
Oh , don ' t worry , I will !
We'd better take it up with them , in that case .
Did you ever talk to him about it ?
I like hot food , especially Sichuan cuisine .
Would you like another beer ?
I'll have another cup of beer insist . I know I don't like to drink alone , especially there are someone sitting there next to me .
Come on , it's the weekend . Let's taste and enjoy this meal . Cheers !
Bottom's up , and you're right . This meal is incredible . I wish I had known this restaurant before . Thanks for bringing me here . I know I'll be back agile soon .
I was sick most of the night .
It sounds like you are coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature .
Have I got a high fever ?
Yes , thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ?
Yes , I have .
Now , let me have a look at you . I'd like to listen to your chest . Now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it Cough , now again . I want to examine your throat , too . Open wide , say ' Ah - - '
Aaaaahh , aaaaahh .
Yes , it does look a bit sore . Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests .
All right , thanks .
The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection .
What shall I do today ?
I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . Take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . Drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . Here's the prescription .
I saw a pair of earrings outside your window . Can you show them to me ?
Do you mean the exquisite pearl earrings ?
Exactly . How much do you want for them ?
They're only three thousand yuan .
What is this setting made of ?
Well , it's specially made of a platinum alloy , sir , and the lustre will never fade out .
I'II take them . Please wrap them up tor me and give me the receipt .
You've made an excellent choice , sir .
I can think of better things to dream about ...
Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away .
That's crazy .
Thank you . But there's still a lot for me to learn .
how time flies . But hey , how are things going with you ?
oh , where to start ? There have been ups and downs . I'm still trying to find my place in this world . It's only recently that I've been able to start settling down . How about you ? You still with Jenn
yeah , Jenny and I got married right after graduation . It was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . I was supporting us both while she continued her studies . But now things are getting better
oh , that sounds wonderful . I have always known you two would make it . I hope I can keep in better contact with you guys . I don't want us to drift apart again .
definitely ! Actually , we just moved into a new place . There's a house-warming party this Saturday , if you are free ? I know Jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party .
sounds great ! I'll be there .
Listen , I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus ?
B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown .
Oh , you mean Canal Street ?
That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown .
Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ?
At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ?
I cannot get hold of her yet .
See you around , Carl .
See you later .
They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest .
I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project .
You'd better pay more attention to your health .
I will , thanks for your concern .
You're welcome .
What does it say ? Do you think he'll see it ?
He'll see it . It says , I like sweets . Meet me at two thirty in the parking lot .
Can I spy on you guys from the window ?
No . But I'll fill you in later . Right now I have to find Vince .
you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion .
I ' m worried that what I say will not make sense .
we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking .
that ' s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ?
that ' s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle .
I didn ' t realize that speaking in class could be so easy .
the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ' t be sure how .
I have not sir . But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here .
Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well .
Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list .
How many people are on the waiting list right now ?
Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list . And you are number 176 .
Very well too , thank you very much . Isn ' t it a lovely day ?
Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot .
Yes .
What's the weather like in your country ?
Mm ... It's quite warm now .
Where do you live ?
In London . Where do you live ?
Here . Near this school .
It's about 5 kilometers .
If we start early , do we have some time for Yuanmingyuan ?
I think so . We can go there in the afternoon if you like .
But I find Japanese ones better .
What else would you like to add ? We highly recommend caterpillar fungus .
Caterpillar fungus ? ! What the heck is that ?
It ' s a special kind of Chinese herb . It ' s good for you !
Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards .
It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case .
I know . But I promise I won't be sleepy tomorrow . I work really hard .
Don't you have the exams coming up soon ? I'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those .
Oh , I nearly forgot the exams .
You do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . Am I right ?
Yeah , I guess so . Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow .
An excellent idea . Work now and play later .
I know you're right . School is more important than TV . Can I watch one more show , then go to bed .
No , now it's bedtime .
OK , here you are .
Thanks a lot .
Yes , I never seem to have any energy .
I'll give you a blood test . Would you roll up your sleeve ? Just as I thought . You're anemic . You'd better pay more attention to your diet . Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . And don't stay up late working . Try to get more rest .
Thank you .
This is Bill Burton from Milford Insurance , I'm calling in regards to our meeting next Tuesday .
Thank you , Mr . Burton . Can you please hold for a moment ? I'll check to see if she is available .
No problem .
I'm sorry , Ms . Jenkins is away from her desk . She has already left for lunch . Would you like to leave a message for her ?
What does that mean exactly ?
Well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers .
What other sources of energy do you use ?
We don't use any fossil fuels . Most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants . We're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power .
You should know that .
Can you just tell me ?
The election is this Tuesday .
Are you serious ?
I ' m not kidding .
It ' s a good thing I asked you .
That should ' Ve been something you knew already .
I couldn ' t remember .
Whatever . Just make sure you go vote .
my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .
true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .
definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .
the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken .
is that inflation ?
inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation .
has the government taken some measures to curb it ?
yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .
but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .
you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .
how ?
for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense .
sounds a good idea .
What ? Are you serious ? You'd defect to our archrival ! ?
Keep your voice down . We'll talk more later . Right now I need to see Vince .
We definitely have to talk , Zina . And watch your back . Elvin is still mad about his nose .
OK , but don't tell anyone what I said .
Sorry , right now we can only have you a room without shower .
Well , that's fine .
Banker ?
Yes ...
Can I have my $ 200 please ?
Sure . Here you are , $ 200 , Thank you , please come again ! Now it ' s my turn to roll the dice .
Not bad , But she's as busy as before .
I care about people and I know the importance of insurance .
Do you have any work experience in promotion ?
Yes , I do . I have worked as a salesman for P & G Company Ltd .
Do people respond well to you ?
Yes , I'm good with people .
Fine . I ' ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on Thursday .
Just walk down the road for a few minutes , and you'll find it on your right .
Thank you very much .
The task is tough .
You'd look before you leap .
Thanks for your concern .
Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy .
You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
But I don ' t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .
I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
Oh , they look nice . May I try that black one on ?
Of course . The fitting room is right over there .
Do you have a medium in the same color ? This one is a little tight .
l'm sorry . All the black of that size are sold out . Would you like a red one ?
OK . Let me try it on . What do you think ?
Oh , that suits you very well . Besides it is believed in China that the red color brings happiness and good luck .
Really ? I'II take it and I'm leaving here tomorrow . Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you get it in ?
Our pleasure . Please fill out this form , leaving your address and telephone number .
Thanks . How much would that come to ?
Let me see ...
Well , now I want to change the date from 24th to 28th .
OK , that shall be arranged .
No , please don't . I couldn't let you do that .
Do you have some quarters ?
I didn't know I needed change .
The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar .
Where do I put the change ?
The quarters go into the slot . You have to push the slot in , and the machine will turn on .
Is that everything that I have to do ?
That's all there is .
I appreciate you helping me with this .
If you need anything else , just let me know .
Yes .
I ' d like to know more about it .
Can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o ' clock ?
OK . I will be there .
Thank you for calling . Goodbye .
Bye .
Well , maybe sneakers or rubber shoes .
Is there any special brand you would like ?
Could I have look at that pair of canvas shoes ? They look nice .
But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too .
I don't know . I just need to try it once . I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight .
You should try swimming then . It helps you to keep fit .
Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary .
Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them .
It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one .
But it's really exciting .
Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one .
Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror .
Yep .
I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind .
Maybe . After all , I am grown up now .
But it won ' t be on my birthday .
But your health is more important . Believe me !
From a sweet ma ? ! It's not worth it . Plus , I'd happily pay more for these things I bought !
F . Y . I . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you're done ...
Ha ! I'm just warming up ! Please take me there now !
Well , maybe I can put them in the airport storage there .
That's right . It's over there .
My son . He is two years old .
I see , sir . This one is very good .
Is it ?
You may rest assured . It sells well .
May I have a look at the introduction ?
Certainly . Here it is .
Yes , how can I help you ?
I ran my car into a tree yesterday and need to miss a few days of school .
Oh , my God ! I hope you are all right .
I have a concussion , but I will be OK .
How much school will you miss ?
I only need to take this week off .
I appreciate you calling and telling me that you won ' t be in class . See you next week !
Oh , I see . But I think you are making a fuss . They will make it up . Bet it .
It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife .
That ' s terrible . But if they wouldn ' t change them , I know what I would do .
hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world .
exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ...
yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies !
why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .
are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ?
never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ?
yeah , I think so .
ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great .
wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases .
It ' s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . It gives the room a good atmosphere .
A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart , and it ' s messing up the room .
But it makes the place feel so much like Christmas . I ' d really hate to have to take it down .
But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ' s been there only because we ' Ve been too busy to get rid of it .
I know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away .
But it ' s falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches .
I know , I know . But it reminds me of the great Christmas we just had . All of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted .
Yeah , it was a good Christmas . It won ' t always be this good , but we can ' t make it last longer than it should .
Ok , fine . We need to take down the tree .
I ' ll make a deal with you . We ' ll leave it up until Sunday , and then we ' ll take it down after church .
Well , your word overrules the file , sir . One moment , please .
I knew you'd see it my way .
Sir , I deleted the $ 10 , but I had to add a $ 2 service charge to your bill .
Am I in the Twilight Zone ? You're charging me for a movie I never saw ?
Please don't blame me , sir . Blame the computer programmer .
This is highway robbery . I've got a good mind to call the police !
If it makes you feel any better , other guests feel the same way .
I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad .
Can I get you anything to drink ? :
Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea .
Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
Thank you .
In half an hour . The surface of the lake is calm .
Yes . We come at the right time .
Please .
Look . Here are the core classes . Everyone has to take them .
So I don't have to worry about them .
You're catching on ! However , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ...
I'll take home economics .
Good . Now you can pick classes by yourself .
How about tomorrow at 11 o'clock ?
She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she ' s around .
For example ?
Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .
No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .
My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .
OK , well , let's coordinate our efforts . Should this party be formal or casual ?
I think it should be casual .
I agree . Next , we have to decide on food . We have a choice of Chinese or Continental Cuisine . Which one should we have ?
I would prefer Chinese food for this party .
Perfect choice . For music , should we have a live band or a DJ ?
I think we should hire a live band .
OK then . Well , I will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on Friday .
Thank you for saying so . Have you seen the exhibition halls ? On display are most of our products , such as silk , woolen knitwear , cotton piece goods , and garments .
Oh , yes . I had a look yesterday . I found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I ' Ve gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I ' Ve got some idea of your exports . I ' m interested in your silk blouses .
Our silk is known for its good quality . It is one of our trade - trional exports . Silk blouses are brightly colored and beau - fully designed . They ' Ve met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand .
I found it very disappointing .
She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see .
I wasn't happy with it .
Nothing is to your satisfaction .
It'll be our pleasure . We'll call you at 7 and then at 7 fifteen .
Oops , cancel that . Change the second call to 7 thirty will you , please ?
No sooner said than done . Can I help you with anything else ?
No , that's about it for now . Thanks .
Okay , sir . Have a pleasant evening .
they must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood .
they're also one of the richest couples . They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want .
I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars .
did either one of them win an Oscar this year ?
I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything .
Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?
yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous .
I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .
people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated .
I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .
that's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go .
thank goodness we're not rich and famous !
being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich .
Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone .
Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere .
I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation .
A shouting match ? You ' re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ' t believe it .
I am not exaggerating at all . I ' m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time .
Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ' t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ' s quite natural to us .
Yes , absolutely true .
No , I haven't got one by now . I will go to the interview of yours .
I mostly did advertising planning .
What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ?
I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market .
What was the most important thing you have learned at work ?
The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success . If I want to make in marking in advertising industry , I can ' t stop studying and creating .
Not bad . It really is great to see you again . Where have you been ?
Guangzhou . I've got a cousin there .
Yeah , yeah . Anyway ... I'm packed . Are you ?
I've been packed for a week . All my stuff is in this backpack .
Let me see ... two books ... birdseed ?
That's trail mix !
Same difference . What's this ?
I am sorry to have kept you waiting . Mr . Johns needs a telephone call from you .
Would you bring the message to my room .
I'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment .
Then I'll come down and pick up the message immediately .
OK , we wait for you .
Anything else ?
Yes . Could you tell many balance ? Here's account number .
You are asking the right person . Here are two very important tips . First , you need to visit no more than one site to find the best products and prices . I can recommend you some online merchants . Second , write your mail address correctly . Otherwise , you can ' t receive your delivery in time .
What about the registration procedure ? Is that complicated ?
Not at all . You just need to provide your name , address , e-mail address , phone number and bank or credit card information . I will help you with that .
It is so nice of you .
I need you to help me .
What can I do for you ?
I am looking for an article in a newspaper .
Did you check the periodicals ?
I didn ' t even bother to think of that .
I ' ll show you where to find your article .
I get lost in this library .
It ' s right this way .
Thanks a lot for your help .
Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better .
Don't you think it's too bloody ?
On the contrary , very exciting .
Poor child !
What's wrong with it ?
It's too small for me to wear .
Would you like another bigger one ?
No thanks . I want to have a refund .
OK , here is your money .
Well , as the saying goes -- we aim to please !
Spring .
How about summer ?
I dislike it most .
Why ?
Because the hottest season is summer in a year .
But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
Look , there's a chessboard . Those two men have already finished playing .
You're a very good player
Not really , but once I won a prize .
So did I . I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners .
My prize was for the best player in the country . Now let's start playing chess seriously .
You need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . You know how I know ?
How ?
Because I won't let it fail .
But what about tomorrow ? What if Stars . com decides to go with WebTracker , and not us ?
No , you can ' t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres .
That's fine .
Your total comes to $ 7 .
Here's a twenty . Could you give me some more napkins ?
Sure . Your cash back is $ 13 . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes .
Thanks .
So what do you provide ?
First of all , we'll design a custom-made work-out plan according to your habits .
How can you get that done ?
Well , we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified . And he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan for your needs .
What else ?
Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal .
Sounds pretty good . What about the charge ?
That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year .
Maybe one month . Just have a try first . Not too tough at the beginning .
Wise decision . You'll find it's totally worth it .
That one there ?
That's right . Then you will follow the signs to Gate 85 .
Thank you . You ' Ve been very helpful .
You must have over 2 years'experience first .
Want to go see a movie tonight ?
My parents are taking me to dinner tonight .
Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ?
What movie did you want to see ?
There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer .
I was thinking that I would like to see " The Secret Life of Bees . "
Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to !
You did ? Wow ! Where did you learn ...
Sorry , but I've gotta run . Enjoy your food , and ring the service button if you need anything else !
It ' s about as complicated as chess . The basic rule and moves are simple enough , but there are many strategies that players need to learn .
I like playing cards . I ' m pretty good at poker . Do you play cards ?
I ' m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling , like poker . If I did , I ' d lose all my money .
Do you play bridge ?
Yes , I do . It ' s hard to find four players though , so I don ' t play very often . Do you know anyone who plays ? If so , we could set up a game .
I can play quite well . I have a friend who likes playing , but she ' s not very good at it . Shall I invite her to play ?
Sure , I have a friend who play fairly well . We should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game .
I ' ll call my friend now . you call yours .
Oh , I hope he didn't notice me .
Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you .
You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ?
I think he might . You'd better go to his office .
You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic .
Good luck !
I don't know , but I feel terrible .
Let me examine you . Don't worry . It's nothing serious .
Do you think I should lie in bed ?
Yes , stay in bed and drink a lot of water . Your fever will be gone in a day or two .
OK . Do you think I can play football tomorrow ?
Of course not . You need a good rest .
OK , I'll listen to you .
What's that ?
That's the Forbidden city on the north of Gate building .
All the sightseeing in china is very attractive and crescive . travelling to China is very worth one . thank you so much for your guides , and I'll miss you .
I recommend you the white wine . It will wake up your appetite .
That's great , bring me a bottle of that please .
Do you know what to get ?
I don't know what we need .
Why don't you go and check the refrigerator ?
I would appreciate it if you would do that for me .
Why don't you just get the basics ?
What do you mean ?
Eggs , milk , bread . Things like that .
Go make that list .
Sure , no problem .
That is great . Do you have to work the night shift ?
No , in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . I work five days a week .
Do you enjoy work here ?
It is hard to say . But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant . Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy .
Take it easy . I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job .
Luckily not . The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss .
Glad to hear that .
I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ?
Doctors aren't sure yet . But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .
You need a babysitter .
Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight . Maybe even for two nights .
I could have Suzy stay at my place .
I don't want to do that to you , Karen .
Why not ?
Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .
I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston . She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .
I'd like to talk with her . This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .
I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .
I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it . But I'd rather have someone a little older .
I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .
Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .
I'm sure you'll pass it .
Is the kitchen plumbing messed up also , or just the bathroom plumbing ?
Just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem .
Did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ?
Everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago .
Are you going to be home so I can come by and take a look at the problem ?
I am not sure if I will be home later .
I will be coming by around 10 this morning . If you aren ' t there , I ' ll just use my key .
Wait a second . He shoots , he scores !
All right !
Here comes Jordan , though .
Wow , Michael Jordan ' s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch .
Yeah . He ' s older , so he doesn ' t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ' s still amazing .
Which team do you think will win ?
The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has .
How do you do ? My name is James Green .
Here's my name card .
And here's mine .
It's nice to finally meet you .
And I'm glad to meet you , too .
Well , since you have come , do it now please ?
That's all . Have a nice stay here .
Thank you . Please get some soap for us .
Just a moment . I will do it right now .
Then we'd better not go .
OK .
I see . That ' s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !
That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ' s eight time zones east of Greenwich !
That ' s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ' s like we went back in time !
Isn't this the car store ?
No . It's Mike's Sporting Goods .
Oh , sorry . Do you know the number for a car store , then ?
No . I don't . I suggest you look in the phone book .
I'm sorry to have bothered you .
No problem .
What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes ?
You need to know the type of shoes you want .
Don ' t worry about that . I can point it out in the store .
The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . In girls shoes , the heel can be high or low .
Let me write all that down . I ' m going shopping this afternoon .
I apologize , but I didn't realize that I did .
Weren't you taught that yellow means slow down , not speed up ?
I did learn that .
So , then why did you speed up ?
I don't know what to tell you .
I'm going to have to write you a ticket .
I understand .
Here you go . Don't do that again .
No , thanks . I already have credit cards .
But our credit card saves you 10 percent .
That's a nice discount .
Here . Let me give you an application form .
Thank you , but I'm just browsing today .
Okay . Enjoy your browsing .
According to your advertisement , you want an experienced software engineer . I think my background meets the requirement of this position .
Then tell me something about your background .
My major was computer science when I was at college , and I am quite familiar with Visual C + + and Java language .
Well , what do you think about the development in computers ?
The developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software . In some regions , the hardware is completely replaced by software . So I think the software industry has a great future .
Have you ever designed any programs concerning network ?
Yes , I have designed some programs for the network with Visual C + + and I have passed the test for programmers - MUSE .
Have you got anything to ask me ?
Yes , can you tell me what's my responsibility in this position ?
Yes , of course . You would be responsible for the development of software products .
I see . This is my advantage .
Good . Have you got any other questions ?
No .
Ok , I will contact you in a week . See you .
Thank you , bye-bye .
Those are the only things you eat ?
That's basically what I eat .
Why aren't you eating anything else ?
Well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy .
And the chicken ?
It's really healthy to eat when you bake it .
I guess that does sound a lot healthier .
That's for the phone calls you made from your room .
Can I pay with traveller's cheques ?
Certainly . May I have your passport , please ?
Here you are .
Could you sign each cheque here for me ?
Sure .
Here are your receipt and your change , sir . Thank you .
Thank you . Goodbye .
Ah , well then I ' d recommend a nice entry-level digital SLR .
Yeah ? Can I take a look at the Sirs you carry ?
Sure thing , follow me . This here is the .
The Canon Eos . Yeah it ' s ok , but I ' m looking for something that performs better in low light , has a better display panel , and longer battery life .
Oh , ah , um the Nikon D60 is a nice option .
Yeah , but what kit lens does this camera come with ? I don ' t want some bulky telephoto lens .
Oh , well this one has the , uh .
Looks to me like an 18-55 mm lens . pretty standard , that will do . Not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything !
So , ahem , can I interest you in any acc ...
Accessories ? Do you carry polarizing filters ?
Polarizing filter um we should ! I ' m sorry , ma ' am . It looks like we ' re sold out .
No you ' re not ! There are some right here !
Oh , well , would you look at that ! Polarizing filters .
Thanks for your help , Ralph !
No problem , ma ' am .
Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests .
You're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ...
I will . Don't worry !
Two air tickets .
Air tickets ?
Yes . We will fly to Paris the day after tomorrow .
We ? The day after tomorrow ? What are you talking about ?
Today is June 18 , isn ' t it ?
Yes . So ?
Think about it !
Then it is June 20 the day after tomorrow .
Yes . Think about it carefully .
Oh , come on . Tell me please . Why did you book tickets to Paris ?
Oh , honey ! Don ' t you remember this important day to us ?
Sorry .
It is our 10th wedding anniversary this June 20 .
Our 10th wedding anniversary ?
Of course . You completely forgot it .
Darling . I think you have made a mistake .
I have made a mistake ?
Yes . We married on July 20 ten years ago .
July 20 ? But I think it should be June 20 .
Yes . We had planned to marry on June 20 , but something happened , so we had to put off our wedding day .
Yes . I remember now . We put it off . I did make a mistake . But how shall we deal with the tickets ?
Since you have booked . Then let ' s celebrate our wedding anniversary before hand .
Banana pie .
Where shall we sit ?
How about there ?
I'll give you some tablets that should make you feel better . One moment , please . Here you are . Take these tablets three times a day swallow them with water .
When should I take them ?
Take on after each meal .
How long should I continue taking them ?
Take them for two days . If your symptoms persist for more than two days , you should see a doctor Also , be sure to drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration .
Thank you for your advice .
How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ?
It's a long story . In a word , I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up .
What are you going to do now ?
I am trying to find a job asap . Lily doesn't know yet . I didn't tell her . I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought I went to work as usual .
That's not the way to solve the problem . Did you look in the classified advertisements column ?
Yes , I did . But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in .
Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand .
I just don't know how to bring it up . Well , all right . She has the right to know anyways .
How many stops are there ?
Two stops after this one .
Could you please tell me when we get there ?
Sure .
By the way , do I need a transfer again after No . 50 ?
No , a No . 50 will take you right there .
Thank you .
Well , what about $ 70 with a scarf ?
It's my rock bottom price . Take it or leave it .
Then what ' s your counter-offer ?
This is our counter-offer .
We are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great .
So are we . Our counter-offer is in line with the world market .
How about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ?
Agreed .
Very well sir . Would you like to have some shirts made also ?
Sure . I ' ll also take some silver cuff link and a pair of silk ties .
Very good . Now , if you will accompany me , we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts .
Great ! B , most of the items listed are available this year . I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts , so as to enable our timely delivery .
That sounds good . But I have a proposal now .
What's the proposal ?
Both of our two parties were involved in the discussion previously . Shall we also allow some of our clients to join us ?
Good idea ! In this way , our clients ' needs will be met and disagreements between the two parties avoided .
Sounds like we have the same idea .
Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food .
OK . I'll be happy to join you .
No problem . See you !
See you !
What did you buy ?
I bought this coat . Do you like it ?
Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ?
At the mall on 5th street .
Was it expensive ?
No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars .
That's cheap .
I know . It was a really good deal .
I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately .
Really ? What's the matter ?
I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad .
Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner .
Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already .
Some people say that history repeats itself .
What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ?
The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same .
I see . I think I ' d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .
What ' s the current interest rate ?
Our monthly interest is 1 . 5 % of the outstanding balance . Would you please fill out the application the form ?
I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring . He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .
What did you do ?
I didn't do anything . Finally , he left . But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .
Did he leave when you left ?
Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .
What did you do ?
Put it on Channel 5 , OK ?
Oh , I hate Channel 5 . I'd rather just listen to the radio .
Don't make such a fuss . I'm sure you will like today's programme .
What's on today ?
A basketball match between Chinese team and American team .
Really ? I'm interested in it .
It might begin now .
I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days .
When did you come to Los Angeles ?
We moved here when I was fourteen .
Did you go to school here ?
Well , I went to high school here , but I went to college in Texas .
Did you get a job right after graduation ?
No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France .
When was that ?
Let's see ... That was about six years ago .
I bet that was interesting . What did you do there ?
I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me . How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ?
Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us , the Insurance Premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle .
Turn on the air conditioner .
It doesn't work .
What happened ?
I don't know .
Did you call the repairman ?
Of course .
When is he coming ?
He's busy . He said next week .
And what is the most important point ?
You should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .
Thank you .
What was your major in school ?
I majored in Public Relations .
Have you done any work in this field ?
Yes , after my graduation , I worked in a trade company in Macao for one year .
What section did you work in ?
The export Business Section .
So you must be very familiar with export procedures .
Yes , very much .
That's good .
You know you didn't .
Well , I am telling you now .
Yes , but you might have told me before .
I didn't think you would be interested .
You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?
Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .
Oh , you men ! You are all the same .
Which do you prefer ?
Hikers tell me that the cream is best because it stays on longer .
Is there anything else I can do to help with the itching ?
You can take an antihistamine .
Thank you so much for all of the information .
You are welcome . Please feel free to ask me a question any time you need help .
wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait !
tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ?
perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank .
no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .
we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning .
great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain .
no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week .
Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us .
Is there some way I can get into contact with him ?
The best way to reach him is by cell phone . I'll give you his number .
Thanks . And could I have his e-mail , just in case I can't get him by phone ?
Sure . His cell phone is 09112223 33 . And his e-mail is lower case t , smith--that's one word , at , c , c , w , dot , com , dot , t , w .
Thank you so much . Does he read his e-mails daily ?
Yes . He usually replies immediately .
Great . Thanks again . You've been very helpful .
My pleasure . I hope you get a hold of him .
It is serious .
It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ?
Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ?
Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike .
Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city .
Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest .
Well , bring him along too . We ' ll have a great time this weekend .
Thanks , I ' ll ask him .
Certainly !
Please ask her to call John .
What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself I think . A friend in need is a friend in deed . The more really close friends I have , the better .
What kind of people do you like to work with ?
People who are honest , dedicated to their work and having integrity .
How about your husband . Does he help much ?
Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ?
That sucks .
If he wasn't so lazy , I think I wouldn't have any complaints . He mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ?
That's crossing the line .
Oh well . I'll have to live with it . What else can I do ?
Will I be able to read the results on the website and understand them ?
Yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about .
How will I know what the numbers mean ?
You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range .
How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ?
We put all of your test results up in the same place . Just check the dates for what you need .
but it looks good . Let me try it on .
Ok , the mirror is over there .
Do you know there are several catagories of Chinese tea ?
Yes , I believe there are green teas , black teas and scented teas . Any Others ?
Well , have you ever heard of Oulong tea and compressed tea ?
Oh , yeah . Oulong tea is good for one's health . isn't it ?
You surely know a lot about Chinese tea .
Sure , I like drinking tea at teahouses .
Oh , so do I .
Why don't we go for one now ?
Great . We can chat while enjoying a cup there .
Let's go !
What course did you like best ?
I like Business Management , and i think it's very useful for the present work .
What do you think is the relationship between the subjects you've taken and the job you are seeking ?
I've taken courses on office administration , reports and correspondence writing . I think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager , because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
Yes , we have some Chinese medicine for common cold .
I heard Chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure .
It depends . It's true that you can take some for prevention .
No trouble at all . May I know your name and room number ?
I'm Du Juan , in Room 312 .
I see . Wait in the room , please .
Thank you for your kindness .
Perfect . It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people .
Will it be an all day event ?
Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library .
That was quick thinking .
There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming .
That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games .
Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you .
My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you .
OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool .
Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that .
Is that really all that you eat ?
That's basically it .
How do you stick to only those foods ?
Actually , fruits and veggies are really good for you .
Yeah , I know , but what about the chicken ?
I mainly eat baked chicken , because there's not a lot of fat .
That does sound pretty good .
I know it does , and that's because it is .
Perhaps one year , I'm not sure .
Silly me .
Now press this button .
Oh , and it's out of paper . Do you have any more ?
Just a second . I'll go get some .
Chinese people don't like to eat cold food .
Is that right ?
But I'm open to new things . I'll have a bowl of cereal , too .
With cold milk ?
With cold milk !
Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped . Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .
Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop .
There . Stop !
Oh , they look just like live cranes .
And what is more , in traditional Chinese thinking , cranes and pine trees symbolize longevity .
Congratulations to you .
Thank you .
What do you mean ? We ' re talking now , aren't we ?
Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together .
Yes . I remember . But we never used to argue . You used to think I was wonderful . Where are you going ?
Back to live with my parents . That's something else I used to do before we were married . Remember ?
Right now we have a suite for 4 people , do you want to book it ?
Yes , that's what I am looking for . I will take the room for 2 days .
Why is that ?
I really love how rain clears the air .
Me too . It always smells so fresh after it rains .
Yes , but I love the night air after it rains .
Really ? Why is that ?
Because you can see the stars perfectly .
I really hope it rains today .
Yeah , me too .
Here is your change . Please wait for your receipt of the registered mail .
I also want to pack up my package . This is the notes .
Let me see . En .. just a minute . Here it is . I need your signature on this note .
Oh , one more thing , where can I mail this letter ?
Drop it in the mail box mark out of town . at that corner .
Thank you very much .
You ' re welcome .
can I buy stamps here ?
sure . How many would you like ?
I need 30 for my Christmas cards .
are you sending them abroad ?
twenty of them are going abroad to China and America .
do you have any going anywhere in the EU ? If you do , those are less expensive .
no .
ok , here you go . That will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence .
and the bubble wrap ?
that ' s another quid .
thanks a lot . You ' Ve been very helpful .
Oh , great ! That ' s at the other end of the terminal !
OK , so here ' s the plan ; When we land , run to gate 14 !
I ' m be right behind ya !
Is classical music your favorite ?
Yes . What about you ?
I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .
Pop music doesn't have any depth for me .
Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it .
Did you always like pop music .
I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music .
I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life .
oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play .
Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy .
I think I must report to the cops .
Ok .
How do you do ?
It's kind of you to meet me at the airport .
Welcome to Beijing . Is this your first time in China ?
No , I have visited China several times , but it's my first visit to Beijing and I think it's a great honor to be invited to your beautiful city .
It's our pleasure to have you here . I hope you will have a pleasant stay here .
Thank you . I'm sure I will have a wonderful time here .
Do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English ?
Yes , in most circumstances .
Are you available for travel ?
Yes , I like travelling . I am young , and unmarried . It ' s no problem for me to travel frequently .
What ' s on ?
Paris in the Spring .
Oh , I ' Ve already seen it . I saw it on television last year . It ' s an old film , but it ' s very good .
Paris is a beautiful city . I have never been there . Have you ever been there , Ken ?
Yes , I have . I was there in April .
Paris in the spring , eh ?
It was spring , but the weather was awful . It rained all the time .
Just like dear old London !
And , who is sponsoring your trip ?
My brother , here , this is an invitation letter from him . I will stay with him and his family in their home .
Alright , tell me about the ties you have to your home country .
Well , I own a house . actually , I ' m leaving my dog there with my neighbors . I have a car at home , and oh , my job ! I ' m employed by Tornal as an engineer . Actually , I only have three weeks ' vacation , so I have to go back to work at the end of March .
And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ?
Well , I do have assets in my country . like I said , I own a house , and see , here ' s a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance .
I ' m sorry , sir , we cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time , instead , you are granted a resident visa ! Congratulations , you are the millionth person to apply for a visa ! You win ! Congratulations !
I didn't know you were a vegetarian !
I'm not , I am a vegan .
A what ?
A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood .
Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough !
It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult .
Maybe the situation is too urgent .
Yes , I think I should have jumped in any case .
No . I'm a sophomore . I take it you are a new student ?
Yeah . It's pretty exciting to be here .
Have fun while it lasts . The excitement wears off real quick . Especially after you see how much homework you get . Where are you from ?
I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here .
I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea .
Why were you in Japan ?
My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures .
That's pretty cool .
I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents .
Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around .
Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class .
Ok .
Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now .
Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ?
You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down .
Ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting .
Zach , what's that on your arm ?
I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing .
It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ?
Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .
I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go .
Shouldn't we make an appointment first ?
We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse .
Whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting !
Yes . Also , I'm not so sure about the color .
Well . It doesn't go with your skirt . I think the color itself is fine though .
Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ' t have got angry .
Did you lend him a lot of money ?
Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back .
Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ' s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ?
No , we didn ' t . I guess you ' re right . We should patch things up .
Of course you should . You wouldn ' t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ?
It has been a pleasure . Goodbye .
Goodbye . Thank you again for coming .
I think you should definitely consider it ! This way you won ' t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ' ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . I can refer you this great
Oh , that ' s great . Thanks Grace . Can you give me her number ? I ' ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow . Maybe this way I won ' t be so tired every day , and Dan and I might even get to go
Can ' t you just tell me now ?
I don ' t know anything for certain . We always do a double check if there is a question .
I want to see you right away .
You can come in this afternoon . If you are feeling too stressed , feel free to bring a friend along .
I know for sure that something is wrong !
Don ' t worry about a thing ; we are just taking a second look and talking .
It must be interesting to study English .
Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss . Parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ?
Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ?
That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www . taobao . com or www . ebay . com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place .
Is the service charged ?
No . it's free .
Really . I'll get a computer at once .
What is the score ?
China beat Brazil three to zero .
Wonderful .
What do you feel about gay marriage ?
I think everyone has the right to love who they want .
Would you legalize gay marriage ?
Yes , I would .
Many people won ' t like that .
I ' m sure they won ' t , but that ' s my view on gay marriage .
I really like you .
I really appreciate that .
I believe you have charged me twice for the same thing . Look , the figure of 6 . 5 dollar appears here , then again here .
I'll just go and check it for you , sir .
Honey , if you don't want to go to cram school , you should tell me the reason why .
I'm sorry , dad . But I would rather stay at school than go to cram school .
But , you were born and raised in California !
Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes .
What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ?
You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice .
So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ?
I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it .
Are you sure he really got the message ?
Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English .
That's hilarious ! What did he say ?
He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good .
I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again .
What are your rates ?
It is RIB 10 yuan initially and 2 yuan for each kilometer .
I have a lot of luggage . Will those fit in the taxi ?
Take it easy . I'll send a larger to pick you up .
Thank you very much .
I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique . I didn't know I could get it cheaper somewhere else .
Of course ! Everything at Helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn't you shop around ?
I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive .
Dark blue .
Have you talk to him about it ?
Not yet , but I have to soon . He's eating me out of house and home . I caught him reading the fridge again last night
Ahahah , Maybe that will help you lose weight .
This is no laughing matter , Nick .
Sorry Paul . I couldn't help it . So why doesn't he give you a hand ?
He watch the tob too much . Now really I don't know . But I can't handle this much longer .
Well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , OK ?
Yes , I really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school .
That's a problem .
I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper .
OK . What about going to the movies on Friday night ?
What were you planning on seeing ?
I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer .
How about " The Secret Life of Bees " ?
That's a chick flick !
By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday .
Good , happy birthday to you !
Not so soon . It ' s not my birthday today . Well , you ' ll come , won ' t you ?
Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me .
My pleasure .
Where is the Computer Center ?
The Computer Center is on the first floor of the library .
Where is the library ?
The library is next to the Adminstration Building . The Adminstration Building is over there near the school ' s main entrance . There are school maps for free in the lobby of the Admin .
Thank you . I will go get one .
Sure . Glad to be of service . By the way , my name is Mike Sullivan . You will see me around a lot . I am running for President of the Student Government .
Well , hi ! My name is Eve Markowski . I am glad to meet you . With your friendly smile and helpful attitude . I am sure you will win .
Thanks you for the encouragement .
You are welcome . I ' d better go . Goodbye .
Have a good day . Bye-Bye !
Haha , I could never do that . I ' d be a zombie if I didn ' t have my morning coffee fix . Let ' s get down to business then .
Yes . I ' Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . The demand for phone cameras is growing , and Pear has been falling behind in the market .
That ' s great ! I ' m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . Is Pear still interested in having those ?
No , we ' re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
Surely . Let ' s get started by drafting a new contract .
All right . Ask me a question now .
Who invented the electric light bulb ?
That's easy . It was invented by Edison .
Correct . Now for a harder question . Who will be the first men on Mars ?
I can't answer that . But I think Mars will be visited by men before theed of this century .
Ask me a question now .
All right . What is the nearest planet to the sun ?
That's easy . It's .. er . Venus . NO . Pluto . No . Wait a minute . It's Anthe tip of my tongue . Oh dear , what is the nearest planet to the sun ?
The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play !
Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men .
Football game ? Ok , and you know what comes on next ?
I believe there ' s a sitcom .
Are you interested in watching it ?
Let me look in the TV Guide first .
Oh , I am sorry . What's on Channel 2 at 10 pm ?
If I remember correctly , it's a quiz show .
Do you want to watch it ?
Let's watch it together .
Let's have a look at the menu . Oh , there isn't a menu . Do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ?
Yes , of course . Excuse me . Could you possibly let us see your menu ? Oh . They haven't got one either .
A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle .
But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you .
We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies .
I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free .
Oh , come on , they give them treat too . Oh , look , that little monkey is so cute .
Cute ? Hope so .
Oh , it is coming to us , come on , Ben , get a banana to it .
Me ? No way , keep him away from me , please .
Why are you acting so strange today ?
I've said that I've got a problem with the circus . I'm not kidding .
That's weird !
No , no . I've got plenty left .
Now I'm confused again ! What is the problem ?
What am I going to do about souvenirs ?
Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs !
Yes , I've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs .
Sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items , and as a guest you get a discount .
Please ! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs .
I understand completely , sir . Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment .
I'm sorry I was such a grouch . It must've been the weather . When it rains I get depressed .
Forget it . I'll see you at 11:30 am .
Yes , it is not easy .
It is OK with me . I enjoy being busy and learning new things .
I agree .
This city is full of jerks .
Rude people are everywhere .
But what can you do ?
You can yell at them .
And they will yell back at you .
Yelling doesn't do any good .
No . The best thing to do is just stay home .
How much do apartments cost around here ?
It depends on what you want . Do you want a one - or two-bedroom apartment ?
I just need a one-bedroom apartment .
That will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month .
Would you come with me to look at apartments ?
I would be happy to look at apartments with you .
Great , so what happens now ?
Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it .
What ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
Let's hope so .
And what date will you be returning ?
Hmm , I guess on the 28th .
Okay , you're booked on American Airlines flight 710 , departing JFK at 6
Sounds good . Thanks a lot .
What do you usually do with them ?
We like to get together , chat and enjoy beautiful music .
Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful .
That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day .
But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope .
Do you have the statement for your card ?
Here it is .
What are the charges you ' re referring to ?
The last four charges on the page .
I ' m afraid we ' re going to have to investigate these charges .
How long will an investigation take ?
I honestly don ' t know , but we will freeze payment on these charges .
That sounds absolutely fantastic .
That looks great . Do you have ties here ?
Sure . Do you have my number ?
Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this .
No problem . I'll wait for your call .
That's the company policy .
What happens if I use up my sick days before the end of the year ? If I ' m sick an extra day or two , will my pay be deducted ?
Yes . That's the company policy .
It was the same as the last place I worked at . I was hoping you ' d be different .
Thank you . I ' m leaving tomorrow morning .
I ' m sure you ' ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country .
I ' m sure I will .
Have a nice journey , Lily .
Thank you , David .
What style do you want ?
I want to buy a V-neck checked sweater , and it should be tight .
Oh , I see . How about the color ?
Quiet color .
I know a shop selling this kind of sweaters .
Really ? Let ' s go there .
Yes .
From Video TV .
Yes , Video TV .
Tell him I telephoned . I'd like to see him about the videotapes . Can he call me this afternoon ?
Yes , Of course . What's your telephone number ?
It's , area code 413 , 447-9626 .
That is 413-447-9662 ?
No , that's 447-9626 .
Oh , I'm sorry , 447-9626 .
Yes , that's right . Extension 162 .
Extension 162 . Okay , Mr . Suzuki . I'll give him the message .
Thank you . Good-bye .
Good-bye .
You're right . He sure is .
That is the pump you are in front of .
Is it expensive ?
It is the most expensive .
Well , I don't want it then . Can I move to another pump ?
Yes , I can give you regular unleaded . But you have to back up the car a little .
Give me regular unleaded then . I will back up . Can you wash my windows for me ?
I'm sorry , sir . This is not a full service gas station . I will help you fill the gas , but we don't wash windows here .
Really ? Well , I guess I have to get used to it .
Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ?
Yes , they say I would get a big sum .
Have you discussed it with your wife ?
Yes , she leaves it to me .
As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary .
I have to think about it .
I agree , I had lunch there last week .
Excellent ! That sounds like a plan .
Around six pm .
Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating .
No . thank you . I can handle it , but thanks for the offer .
Ok , I will see you then .
Great , have a good day , thanks again for the offer .
Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me !
Why ? I don ' t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
They don ' t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do .
A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due .
Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible .
I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries .
So do I .
I want to get some pie .
What kind of pie do you want ?
I have no idea .
Do you want to know what kind of pie I like ?
Sure , what kind do you like ?
I love apple pie .
Oh , I love apple pie too .
There you go . Problem solved .
Model of computers aren't compatible ?
Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities .
Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable .
But by then , the technology will be outdated .
True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge .
That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable .
This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product .
I guess you get what you pay for .
Sorry , I am not sure , can I take a message ?
No , thanks . I'll call back later .
That's fine . please call again later .
Ok , thank you . Goodbye .
I thought you knew .
I honestly didn't know .
The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .
That's good to hear .
Will you go and visit them ?
Of course I will .
I just wanted to give you the good news .
Thanks for letting me know .
I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ' t it hideous ?
I guess .
Are you even listening ? I ' m trying to have a conversation with you .
And I ' m trying to watch the game , but you ' re yapping on about your new clothes !
Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon !
Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ' s the third quarter and you ' Ve been blabbering on since the first !
Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
Oh no you didn ' t . You didn ' t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ' t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game !
How much is the ticket ?
It's 86 coach and 175 berths
One berth , please .
What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ?
The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior .
How do you organize and plan for major projects ?
I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario . Then , I set a timetable that's realistic . What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react .
Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure .
I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks . The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me . Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed .
How do you manage your time in a typical day ?
I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value . The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week .
Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion .
I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings .
And when do you get home at night ?
I get home pretty late , around midnight .
So what do you do , exactly ?
I'm a TV announcer . Don't you recognize me ? I do the weather report on KNT !
Gee , I'm sorry . I don't watch TV .
I know a very interesting place .
Oh , do you ? Good .
Is it close by ?
It's down a block on the right ; can I show you the way ?
OK , I'd love the company .
This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it .
That's Lincoln .
What is it ?
Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others .
That makes you feel uncomfortable ?
Yeah . we never do that in a public office .
Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy .
I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding .
Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus .
Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ?
Yeah .
Oh , I'm shocked .
I see . We will go the day after tomorrow .
By the way , what kind of stores do we need to go ?
I want to buy some clothes in clothing store . When we are going back , go to the butcher's shop and buy some chicken .
Let ' s also go to the jewelry store to buy a crystal necklace . I want to buy one for you as your birthday present .
Thank you , darling .
Let's get frozen juice . It is really good . We ' Ve got enough food . Let ' s go over to the check-out stand .
OK . But just let me pick up a bottle of cooking wine and oil as we go by .
Are you sure ? I thought I said it was my mother .
I don't think so . But it could've been .
Well . You can trust me this time . My sister is definitely sick . I'm just coming from the hospital . They say she might even die .
I don't buy your story . Try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ?
I'll do my best .
Just try to be a little more punctual in the future .
I'm working on it . Really !
Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am .
Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ?
Well , surfing , scuba diving ...
Well , as far as I can tell , we qualify .
Of course we will need proof , originals and duplicate of everything . As soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed .
Oh , really ? are there any snakes ?
Snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .
That's terrific . I can't wait to check it out .
Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?
Why not ? it's so cool .
But it will pose a risk to your health .
Pardon ?
I mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems .
Well , I didn't realize that .
I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .
Oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .
Yes , good luck , Maria .
OK . Here you are .
Could I have some fruit ?
Of course . Wait for a moment , please .
Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like .
Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?
Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered .
What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste .
Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag .
That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear .
What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password .
It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough .
I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping .
Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .
That's a good idea .
Certainly .
And how many pieces did you have ?
Two suitcases and a handbag . The suitcases are blue and the shoulder bag is red .
Is there a name tag attached to them ?
Yes , there is .
We're very sorry for the delay . I'll check immediately and call you back .
I know . But it is my lucky charm . I carry it all the time .
Suit yourself . Don ' t forget to set the alarm clock .
no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions .
it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America .
religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal .
what do you think about abortion ?
I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself .
do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?
I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children .
why not ? It's their children , too .
that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand .
that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter .
Mmmm ... a photo I . D . I have my New Jersey driver ' s license . Is that ok ?
That will do . What an interesting picture ! How old is it ?
Actually it wad taken just last year , but I had a shaved head and a beard . Can you still recognize me ?
Barely . Will you be checking any luggage today ?
Yes , One suitcase . I also have a carry-on bag .
Ok . Mr . Lee , you ' re all set . Your flight leaves from gate 10 . Boarding begins at 10:30
A good suggestion for you . You need a holiday .
It wasn't always like this , you know .
What do you mean ?
Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives .
You need a holiday . That's what's the matter .
Certainly , perhaps .
Our sniffer dog seems to disagree . Do you mind if we look in your suitcase ?
Not at all . Go right ahead .
What ' s this sir ?
It ' s traditional Chinese Medicine . I mix it with hot water like tea . Sorry . I forgot about it .
What are these red things sir ?
Oh no ! I forgot about those too ! Those are Chinese sausages for my Aunt Lily .
I ' m sorry sir , but you can ' t take any of this into the country . We will also have to check your carry-on . Please step this way . Don ' t ' be nervous ; we ' ll just look through it briefly and then
These books were due two weeks ago .
Yeah . I totally forgot they were due .
You will need to pay late fees on these books .
How much are the late fees ?
The fee is 25 cents every day .
I have to pay 25 cents a day ?
And that ' s for each book that is late .
That shouldn ' t be a problem .
All right , Mr . Cook . I'll have Mr . Baker call you back as soon as he gets here .
Have you received any honors ?
Yes . I got the title of " Advance Worker " in 2006 .
Do you have any publications ?
Yes . I wrote a thesis entitled " On Interpersonal Relations in the Socialist Market Economy " and it was published in China Daily .
Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
What do you drink ?
Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
A little bit . I'll take a look if you want me to .
Please . Thank you so much for stopping .
Yeah , she's hot . Radiator's leaking . Looks like you were running her pretty hard .
That must have been just before I got the speeding ticket .
Did you have an accident recently ... Hey , wait a second ! I know this car !
You do ?
I ran into it a couple of weeks ago . What do you know ? Name's Hal .
I'm Akimbo . Nice to meet you , I guess .
Boy , I'm sure sorry about your car . Hey , Akimbo , I wonder if you'd like to make a deal ?
What kind of deal ?
I'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car .
You don't want your insurance company to pay for it ?
I'd rather not . They'll raise my rates . It'll cost me more in the long run .
If you give me cash , do you care if I don't fix the car ?
Hell , I don't care . Just don'T submit a report to your insurancecompany .
It's a deal , Hal . Thanks again for stopping to help . And thanks for smashing my car !
I see . You simply can't blame the server for this .
Yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district .
That's true .
Anyway , how was your such , Catherine ?
It was good . I brought lunch from home today .
You did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America .
Well , I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy .
I guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat .
Yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , don't you ?
You bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America .
Well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places .
Seriously ?
Yeah , it's hard to believe but true .
Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening . Would you like to come with me ?
Sure . Thank you very much .
Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty . OK ?
Ok , see you .
See you .
We'd like a non-smoking table , please .
Come with me , please .
Yeah . I think I can find it .
You're back already . That sure was quick .
That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me .
Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . Anyway . He said it was too close to closing time .
Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway .
Okay , let's go !
No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years .
Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul .
Well . Good for him .
Does your husband feel the same ?
Yes . He is very understanding and supportive .
Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position ?
I am more interested in a full-time position . However , I would also consider a part-time position .
Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ?
I advised customers on financial matters . After I consulted the customer , I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis .
What is your greatest strength ?
I am an excellent communicator . People trust me and come to me for advice . One afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
What is your greatest weakness ?
I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . However , I began setting time-limits for myself .
Why do you want to work for our company ?
After following your firm's progress for the last 3 years , I am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and I would like to be a part of that team .
When can you begin ?
Immediately .
Which condiment do you use for ?
I'll use ginger , garlic scallion , hot pepper and vinegar .
Very good , need I help you ?
No , don't need , I can do myself .
Thanks . I can watch TV now .
But you must cook that dinner next time .
Okay , I'll do it next time .
Thank you .
Come on , baby . It ' s time now .
Mam , another minute , could I ?
Hurry up , little boy .
You really are lucky !
Yeah , I know .
Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ?
Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat .
That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ?
It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy .
I guess it does seem logical . I'll have to check it out !
It's about a girl . No , an angel ! I'm going to the coffee shop where she works right now .
It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
Sorry , love .
What are you looking for now ?
My cigarettes .
Well , they ' re not here . They are in the dustbin .
In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ?
Can I send it in now ?
You should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due . If it hasn ' t been , we will still accept it .
Can I mail it in early next time so it isn ' t late ?
Actually , you cannot mail it in early , as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date .
Will my paycheck come right away now ?
Your check will arrive a little late .
Where was the break-in ?
It happened at my house .
Was anything stolen ?
I haven't checked yet .
Why do you think there was a break-in ?
My front window was broken .
We'll send a squad car shortly .
I'd appreciate that .
You ' re getting married in three weeks . So that should be ok . So , you ' Ve prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel-everything .
Yes . We ' Ve taken care of all of that . We decided not to get married in a church though . Neither of us is very religious .
Which hotel will the reception be held at ?
The palace hotel they ' re taking care of the catering , including the wedding cake . I ' m sure they ' ll do a good job .
Oh , yes . It ' s and excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
Yes . It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . It gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people .
I think you make the right decision .
Maybe you can hire me on trial . If I'm not qualified for the job , you can let me go .
Good idea .
That's much more convenient . We don't even have to bring the flavorings .
Can you tell me more ?
Is everything ready now ?
Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive .
Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .
Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet .
It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ' t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available .
Thank you .
My pleasure .
Thanks so much .
Oh ... I'm such a newbie . But at least I'm sure I'll get that tennis racket .
Don't count on it , Babe . eBay is always full of surprises .
Well ... guess how low the bidding starts on the tennis racket ?
And we have some squabbles on some boring things .
This is ordinary marriage life .
Yes , I want to know about the battle of Gettysburg .
O . K . Well , go to google . com , and type in " Battle of Gettysburg . "
Oh wow , there are a lot of sites .
Here , try this one . It ' s a good site about Gettysburg .
Thanks .
For detailed information , however , you should read a history book .
Thanks . If I ' m interested , I ' ll go to the library .
Great . What types of things will we do at Lushun Falls ?
The second day you take a four-hour city tour . In the afternoon you go on the famous boat cruise under the falls .
I never bought food from the cafeteria .
You haven't ? They have a lot of good stuff .
What do they have ?
They sell everything .
Well , I want Chinese food .
I've gotten chow mein from there before .
I guess we can eat there then .
Trust me , the food isn't half bad .
Here's the swimming pool . It's open from 10 a . m . to 11 p . m . There are also massage rooms here .
That's wonderful ! I like swimming .
what do you usually write about ?
at first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my family an
that's interesting . How often do you write a blog ?
it's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks .
got it . Are you still updating your blog ?
sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like .
good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months .
Fine . They look nice . I will take both of them .
May I have a look at your passport , please ?
What do you think our chance are in other events .
In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ' ll do well in those same events .
We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice .
I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total .
You are very optimistic !
You mean that you can them .
That's right . I can see them in my dreams .
They come to the earth ?
No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space .
Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ?
OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings .
That means that you talk to them ? In which language ?
Of course in English , they learn English on Mars too .
Wow . Sounds fantastic !
Well , congratulations . When is the big date ?
In June .
Did you have the watch before getting the ring ?
Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch .
You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous .
Thank you so much .
What kind of watch is it ?
It's a Tag Heer .
If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ?
This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .
That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for .
Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .
Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?
The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
How are they at swimming ?
They ' re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ' s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ' re not very fast , but that ' s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
I ' d be afraid to jump from that height !
I think that these kinds haven ' t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher .
It seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further .
How much is it ?
180 yuan , and you can get a free 8 piece gift package .
What's included in the gift package ?
Some black mascara , moisturizing orion , eye cream crystal lipstick , a two color eye shadow pack , styling hairspray , and a cosmetics bag .
Sounds not bad .
We will take the trip . Could you give us a pamphlet ?
Here you are .
I parked in the red zone .
Why did you do that ?
I needed to get something really quick .
Where did you park at ?
At my apartment building .
Don't you have your own parking spot ?
I needed to be fast .
That was very lazy of you .
Well , if you just take a look here , see , with our chequing account , you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee , and our savings account has a higher interest rate , but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars .
I see , well , I think I ' m more interested in a chequing account . I like to have easy access to my money .
Alright , then , with this chequing account you ' ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . Will you require overdraft protection ? There is an extra fee for that .
No , that won ' t be necessary .
In that case , I ' ll get you to fill out this paperwork . I ' ll need your social insurance number , and two pieces of government ID . If you could just sign here , and here , and here . we ' ll be all set . Would you like to make a deposit today ?
Yes , I ' d like to deposit one billion dollars .
In the van .
What about other expenses ?
Let ' s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ' t spend much . Come on . Don ' t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ' t we ?
Maybe you ' re right . When do you plan to go ?
The sooner the better ! I can ' t wait !
Oh , I don ' t know where we ' re going yet .
As long as we ' re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time .
Let ' s go to Chicago . We can have lunch in Chinatown . Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field !
You have such good ideas !
I need job security .
Would you be able to relocate ?
I am open to relocating .
What are your annual salary requirements ?
I need at least 75,000 per year .
I ' ll keep that in mind . Thank you for coming in today . We ' ll be in touch .
Thanks a lot
You are welcome
Thanks a lot .
Not at all .
Great ! Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ?
No , make the second one with ham , pineapple and green peppers . Oh , and make it thin crust .
Okay , thin crust . Your total is $ 21 . 50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ' s free !
Perfect . Thank you . Bye ..
wait ! ! I need your address !
I love that kind of stuff .
Yeah , you seem to like those styles .
Sure do . I get a kick out of looking punk .
This one looks really expensive though .
I don't care how much it costs . I'm rolling in it .
Lucky you ! I can't buy anything else . I'm flat broke .
I got a replace my party outfit , I trashed it last week .
Why did you drag me into this ? I've spent a week salary .
Are you on the level ? You're the one who called me , remember ?
Just joking , Tonia . I've got some wonderful clothes . Let's go and have a close look at your outfit .
I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
How much do you think the rent will be ?
I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
That's great !
Does the 7th floor belong to our company too ?
Yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building .
It ' s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ?
Yes , at the end of the hall .
No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital .
Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ?
Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus .
Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 .
But number 13 buses leave from the center of town . You ' ll have to walk two miles to catch one .
I ' Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people .
What ? Why ? I mean , we ' Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ' re happy together , aren ' t we ?
That ' s just it , I ' m not happy anymore , Tim . It ' s not you , it ' s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
So , what are you saying ? You ' re breaking up with me because I ' m perfect ?
Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ' ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ' d only hurt you , I know I ' d only make you cry .
Baby , come on . Don ' t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ' t leave me .
I can ' t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ' m only doing this for you . I don ' t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do .
Laura ...
Here are your keys . I ' ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ' m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ' ll always love you . Goodbye .
Never mind being sorry , what are you going to do about it ?
Don't worry , we'll soon fix them .
Good , I hope you'll make sure that it won't happen again .
I'll certainly look into that .
Thank you . Goodbye .
In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies .
I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time .
When you become a permanent employee , you will have the insurances . You will get monthly pay and will be on eight-hour / day work shift .
Wait , will I have five insurances and one fund ?
Yes . You can also enjoy legal holidays and year-end bonus .
It sounds great !
If you need to work overtime , you will get twice the usual salary as overtime pay .
OK .
You have read the relevant terms of the contract . Do you have other questions ?
How long will the induction training be ?
About two weeks .
I see .
If you don't have other questions , just sign here .
OK .
OK . Thanks a lot .
That's nothing .
Mary , can I get Josh or you something to drink ?
Oh no , thank you . We aren't all that thirsty .
How about a little snack then ?
No , thank you , we just ate lunch a little while ago .
Well then , how is your family ?
Everyone is doing great . My sister finally had her baby .
Well . I like the Thom Birds best .
Is it very interesting ?
Sure . I like the writer's language , too .
If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book .
Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
That's a good idea . Let's go !
Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ?
Mmm . That's what I thought too . I really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . And I always enjoy watching Pierce Brosnan .
Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ?
Not as much as last time , actually . What's the name of the American actor who was in the supporting role ?
Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . Did you like him ?
Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together , don't you think ?
I don't know . I think the woman was better . She provided a good love interest . Lucky James Bond !
Yes !
Now , I'd like to get things under way . The main topic on today's agenda is the development of a U . S . sales strategy for the new EBB . I'd like to hear all of your ideas , Mr . Wall , you seem in top form today . Could you start the ball rolling ?
Uh , oh , sure . Well , I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising .
Well , that's kind of obvious .
Give me a break , Mr Yang .
Uh , let's keep this going , shall we ?
Is it easy to learn ?
Yes . it is I can teach you if you like .
Thank you . I can teach you how to bowl .
Right . Let's help each other .
so , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ?
ok . You haven ' t seen my company car , have you ?
no . let me take a look ... it ' s longer than my car .
I think it ' s over five meters long . I can ' t remember exactly . It has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour .
wow ! That ' s fast ! I don ' t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway .
we can ' t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit .
OK . The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan . On that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river .
Why do people eat rice cakes on that day ?
In order to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body .
It sounds so moving .
Thank you very much .
You ' re welcome .
Is it really worth paying for ?
I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter .
If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
Certainly . How about this one ?
This will be fine , thanks .
( Handing her a menu ) Your waiter will be here in a minute to take your order .
Thank you .
You're right . Too much or too little won't do any good .
The trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
Sounds reasonable .
We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
And fruits !
Surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .
I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
Yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can also help one to keep sound physical health .
I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .
You bet it !
I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel .
Oh , how awful ! Let me have a look , I'm terribly sorry . It was most thoughtless of me . Would you excuse me , please ?
Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes .
It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ?
All right . Thank you .
Just a minute , please . I won't be long . I'm sure this one is perfect . You may examine it carefully .
Oh , yes , it is . I'll take this one .
I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you .
Well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing .
That ' s all right . We ' ll teach you .
Is it anything like American football ?
Not very much . It ' s something like hockey , except that you use a big ball and no stick .
I ' ll come down and watch you play some day , and see what it ' s like .
Good idea . I think you ' ll like it if you give it a chance .
We don ' t have a national day .
Really ? That ' s unusual .
I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don ' t .
Actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . In the evening , many people watch special TV shows which celebrate national day .
Sure . What ' s your number , please .
519 367 8901 .
Thanks . And your name is Tony , right ?
Yes . I ' m Tony . Thank you very much .
You ' re welcome . Bye .
Bye .
Certainly . No one who evades tax can escape from their detection . They ' ll check your income through computers . You'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . If you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined .
What did you watch ?
I saw the Sixth Sense . I didn't know it was going to be so scary .
I remember that . It was a great movie . But it was definitely scary .
If you're not busy , do you want to come over ? I'm afraid to be alone .
Sure . I can come over . What should we do ?
How about if we watch a comedy . I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense .
Ok . I'll get ready and leave . I'll see you in about 20 minutes .
Hurry , ok . It's dark out .
Don't worry , nothings going to happen . I'll be there real soon .
Ok . See you soon .
The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins .
Have you ever tried it ? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ?
It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day .
It may take less time , but I don't know about easier . Yuck .
Push the red button on the mike to turn it on .
OK . This key is too high for me .
I think it's a piece of cake for you .
OK . Let me have a try ...
Well done ! I hope I can sing as well as you one day .
Thank you . I'm sure you will .
I hope so . Thank you for saying so .
Very well . This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
I think I ' m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ?
Mmm , well this is our I ' m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
I don ' t think that ' s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better !
I ' m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ?
Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .
Get out of my store , you jerk !
Please .
Not a chance .
Not even for an hour ?
Sorry , it ' s impossible .
But it's true .
How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ?
That's coincident .
Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time .
I promise I will .
You'd better .
It will cost you $ 10 .
By the way , what's the time ?
You can see the time on the meter . I have radio time , you know .
It's a quarter to 12 . Could you please drive a little faster ?
Certainly .
I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies .
But you must take the design and quality into consideration . You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with .
I agree that yours are of the top .
Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ?
To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help .
Impossible . How about 5 % off ?
Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable .
Can you fill it ?
I ' m afraid not . The tooth is too far gone . it'll have to be taken out .
Then I might as well have it done now .
you ' d better wait , the gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days .
I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .
well , let's get a plate of those then .
sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ?
I think I might have a dahl .
what's in a dahl ?
it's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .
that sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
ok . How about some lamb kebabs ?
that's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ?
I think I'll have a beer .
ok , shall I flag down the waitress ?
I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round .
you're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me !
what would you do without me ?
We can change only three kinds of currency , USD , Japanese Yen and HK Dollar in our savings office .
Could you tell me what the exchange rate for USD is today ?
The buying rate is 826 . 44 yuan for 100 dollars .
I want to change some Us dollars to cover my expense here .
Please go to Counter No . 2 , the foreign exchange counter . It's over there .
Thank you .
Maybe he is on the way home now .
I'm very glad to hear that .
Come here , let me introduce some friends to you .
You too .
No , Madam . I don't think I do .
It's the 11th Avenue , Park Street .
Oh , yes . I know where it is .
That's right .
It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public .
Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio .
I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio .
Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line .
You say that now , Lily , but you'll thank me later . I'm your mom , and mother knows best .
Did you lose any weight ?
YES . I ' Ve lost quite a few pounds since last month .
when was the last time you have track up ?
About two month ago .
Let me take your blood pressure . You look anilic . Well , Mr . Brown . I ' m happy to say it ' s nothing serious . You just a little run down from overwork .
What am I suppose to do ?
I think you ' ll needs just vacation . Try to get out doors more . I ' ll be sure if you get more rest .
Thank you , doctor . I ' ll do what you say .
I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves .
You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different .
Do the drivers speak English ?
Some are better than others . But , you shouldn't have a problem .
Are they safe ?
For the most part , yes . If you don't feel comfortable with it , then it is best not to take one at night .
He must have just got online for the first time last week . He still thinks it's some kind of new toy .
Well , historically it is a practice that many cultures share . Reading the tarot cards , in the east they would even read tea leaves ! I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes .
All superstitious nonsense ! I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks .
But they're just ads .
Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends .
The park will close soon . We Should better go in right now .
Really ?
Yes , let's go in .
It is a new park , isn't it ?
Yes , how do you know ?
I guessed it .
Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well .
Oh , how wonderful !
My plans are to be there April 14th to the 17th .
We have new room rates , sir . Will that be acceptable to you ?
Well , it depends on the price , of course . What is it ?
It's $ 308 a night .
I have no problem with that .
Great ! Would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking ?
Definitely nonsmoking . I can't handle that smell .
Nonsmoking . Now , is a queen-size bed okay ?
No problem .
Great , Mr . Sandals . Your reservation is confirmed . Now all I need is your phone number .
Of course ! It's area code 626-555-1739 .
Thank you so much , Mr . Sandals . We look forward to seeing you !
Me too .
Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .
Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?
Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited .
He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .
And the host announced that he won it all !
Yes , sir . I'll bring it over . Have you decided what you'd like , sir ?
Will you make some recommendation ?
Oh , yes . How old are you ?
Twenty .
Hum , still a student ?
Yes , I'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics .
What subjects are you studying ?
English , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy .
Have you had any working experience .
Well , I worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays .
What do you like to do in your spare time ?
I like sports very much . Besides that , I also like working on a computer in my spare time .
How are your English and computer skills ?
I have passed the CET - 4 and 6 . As far as computer is concerned I can use the computer for word processing .
Okay . Mr . Liu , we'll inform you of the results within a week .
This home is gorgeous on the inside !
Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new .
The wall colors totally suit the style of this house .
Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen .
I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops .
The master suite is the best . Let ' s go look at that next .
There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room .
I know that you like this house , but let ' s take a look at the others before you make up your mind .
Happy anniversary ! Sorry you won ' t be there . Maybe some other time ?
Yeah , maybe . Thanks , anyway . Hope you guys have a great time !
She ' s your sister . What she asked was only duck soup for you . Why can ' t you be good to her ?
But I am her brother , not her servant .
Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ?
Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff .
Well , welcome to the team .
What does it say ?
This is an especially famous one . It says " May the passing days bring you health and longevity . May this season of renewal find you basked in riches . "
That's very nice . Is it for sale ?
No . I never sell my artwork .
Really ? Then what do you do with it ?
I give it away . Here , this one is for you .
Wow ! Really ? Are you sure ? Now I'll have a lucky year !
Remember , real luck must be created ( by ) yourself , and then it cannot be given or taken away ...
Put your luggage on the scale , please . Oh , your luggage is overweight .
How much is the excess baggage part charge ?
Twenty-two dollars
Here you are .
This is your voucher , and you can get your luggage back on this . Have a good trip !
Thank you !
Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ' t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
OK sir , please wait a minute .
what a bummer ! You set me up ?
let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ...
Please mail this letter for me on your way to the store .
Sure . Do you want it to be registered ?
Yes , I think so . There are some pictures in it . It would be a great pity if they were lost .
Yes , I will be glad to mail your letter .
Thanks .
you are welcome .
The color is too bright . For my age , I would prefer a lighter color .
I didn't think of it . Thank you . And I do apologize for being late .
Hmm , 250NT is ... 8 dollars ? ! ! And you can't even eat them ? You're crazy !
Wait ! Don't go just yet . These bananas are pretty cheap--only 35NT for this bunch .
Now that's more like it ! Bananas have lots of potassium , too !
They're also good for your digestion ! Would you like some kiwis , too ?
Are they from Taiwan ?
They're imported from New Zealand . Four for 50NT . Nine for a hundred .
OK . I'll take four kiwis .
It says it's located in the suburbs .
Yes , sir . American breakfast with fried eggs sunny side up . Breakfast juice and black coffee . And my correct , sir ?
Yes , that ' s right .
Is there anything else , sir ?
No , that ' s all .
Good morning , sir . I ' Ve got breakfast your ordered .
Just put it on the table please .
Do you need anything else , sir ?
No , thanks . Oh , yes , could I have some juice for the mini bar ?
What kind of juice do you like sir ?
Tomato or orange juice , please .
Yes , sir . I ' ll get them for you right away . Would you please sign this bill first ? Thank you , sir .
Yeah , what's up with that ?
The kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . Hide away , Yi-jun !
Don ' t worry . There ' s plenty of time yet .
But it ' s Friday today . This road is always jam packed during the weekend , isn ' t it ?
Right .
I'm sorry to hear that . I'll have to examine you .
Ok , go ahead .
Open your mouth and show me your tongue . Say ah ... You have a bad cold . So you must stay in bed for a week .
How long have you been learning it ?
About three years .
Can you speak any other languages ?
I'm afraid not .
What do you need to take it for ?
I'm trying to get my license .
You need six hours .
Can I do all six hours in one day ?
You have to do it in three days .
That's all I have to do ?
That's everything .
Well , that's a relief .
No problem at all , Mr Waterstone . Any preference as to how you want the money ?
Anything you like , but not too many large notes . It's useful to have smaller notes .
Here we go , Mr Waterstone . Here's your money and your interest note .
Yes , yes . Everything's fine . Thank you very much , Becky .
Sure . Let me help you .
What ' s the time ?
Six thirty , tonight .
Oh , I ' m sorry I can ' t because I have to do some housework . You can ask Jenny to go with you
All right . Maybe next time I can go with you . Bye !
Good bye !
Hang on a tick and I'll check for you . I'm sorry ; we have no record of that arriving .
OK , thanks for checking . Could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ?
No problem . I'll be in touch as soon as it comes in .
I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed .
Now with video rentals it's all a personal matter .
Yea , I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either .
Now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't .
May I try it on ?
Go ahead .
Is there a mirror around here ?
Right over there .
Does it suit me ?
Yes , you look very nice .
How much is it ?
We're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax .
That's quite reasonable .
He's fine . He retired last week . It's a turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .
He can spend more time with his grandchildren .
Oh , I don't think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea !
How do you want to spend your old age ?
In the same way , probably .
He has a mustache , if I remember correctly , and a light complexion .
How old is he ?
He is in his late thirties .
Well . I shouldn ' t have any trouble recognizing him . What time does his flight arrive ?
At 2 thirty .
There is a wait for the computers .
That ' s all right .
You need to print your name on this list .
Okay . Now what ?
Once a computer is available , I will let you know .
How am I supposed to log on to the computer ?
All you do is type in the number on the back of your card .
That ' s it ? Thank you very much .
I ' m sorry , but you won ' t be able to view it today .
Why not ?
You have to make an appointment first .
Oh , okay . Can I do that right now ?
Is this Friday okay ?
Is 6 o ' clock Friday evening okay ?
Yes , I will schedule you for that time .
Thank you very much . See you then .
Would you like a drink ?
Let me have a soda .
What kind of soda would you like ?
May I have a Sprite , please ?
Sure , no problem .
I would also like a bag of chips .
Will that be all ?
That's everything .
What ' s the problem ?
I wrote the check out for way too much .
How much ?
I wrote the check out for $ 150 .
What were you supposed to write it out for ?
I was supposed to write the check out for $ 100 .
I ' ll just cancel it for you right now .
That ' s great . You ' re a lifesaver .
Oh that will be lovely . You ' ll be able to do lots of shopping I expect .
Oh yes and try lots of new food too .
Great . Make sure you buy me a souvenir !
Oh , don ' t worry , I will !
Would you like another beer ?
I'll have another cup of beer insist . I know I don't like to drink alone , especially there are someone sitting there next to me .
Come on , it's the weekend . Let's taste and enjoy this meal . Cheers !
Bottom's up , and you're right . This meal is incredible . I wish I had known this restaurant before . Thanks for bringing me here . I know I'll be back agile soon .
It sounds like you are coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature .
Have I got a high fever ?
Yes , thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ?
Yes , I have .
Now , let me have a look at you . I'd like to listen to your chest . Now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it Cough , now again . I want to examine your throat , too . Open wide , say ' Ah - - '
Aaaaahh , aaaaahh .
Yes , it does look a bit sore . Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests .
All right , thanks .
The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection .
What shall I do today ?
I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . Take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . Drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . Here's the prescription .
Do you mean the exquisite pearl earrings ?
Exactly . How much do you want for them ?
They're only three thousand yuan .
What is this setting made of ?
Well , it's specially made of a platinum alloy , sir , and the lustre will never fade out .
I'II take them . Please wrap them up tor me and give me the receipt .
You've made an excellent choice , sir .
Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away .
That's crazy .
oh , where to start ? There have been ups and downs . I'm still trying to find my place in this world . It's only recently that I've been able to start settling down . How about you ? You still with Jenn
yeah , Jenny and I got married right after graduation . It was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . I was supporting us both while she continued her studies . But now things are getting better
oh , that sounds wonderful . I have always known you two would make it . I hope I can keep in better contact with you guys . I don't want us to drift apart again .
definitely ! Actually , we just moved into a new place . There's a house-warming party this Saturday , if you are free ? I know Jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party .
sounds great ! I'll be there .
B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown .
Oh , you mean Canal Street ?
That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown .
Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ?
At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ?
I cannot get hold of her yet .
See you around , Carl .
See you later .
I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project .
You'd better pay more attention to your health .
I will , thanks for your concern .
You're welcome .
He'll see it . It says , I like sweets . Meet me at two thirty in the parking lot .
Can I spy on you guys from the window ?
No . But I'll fill you in later . Right now I have to find Vince .
I ' m worried that what I say will not make sense .
we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking .
that ' s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ?
that ' s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle .
I didn ' t realize that speaking in class could be so easy .
the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ' t be sure how .
Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well .
Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list .
How many people are on the waiting list right now ?
Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list . And you are number 176 .
Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot .
Yes .
What's the weather like in your country ?
Mm ... It's quite warm now .
Where do you live ?
In London . Where do you live ?
Here . Near this school .
If we start early , do we have some time for Yuanmingyuan ?
I think so . We can go there in the afternoon if you like .
Caterpillar fungus ? ! What the heck is that ?
It ' s a special kind of Chinese herb . It ' s good for you !
It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case .
Don't you have the exams coming up soon ? I'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those .
Oh , I nearly forgot the exams .
You do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . Am I right ?
Yeah , I guess so . Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow .
An excellent idea . Work now and play later .
I know you're right . School is more important than TV . Can I watch one more show , then go to bed .
No , now it's bedtime .
Thanks a lot .
I'll give you a blood test . Would you roll up your sleeve ? Just as I thought . You're anemic . You'd better pay more attention to your diet . Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . And don't stay up late working . Try to get more rest .
Thank you .
Thank you , Mr . Burton . Can you please hold for a moment ? I'll check to see if she is available .
No problem .
I'm sorry , Ms . Jenkins is away from her desk . She has already left for lunch . Would you like to leave a message for her ?
Well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers .
What other sources of energy do you use ?
We don't use any fossil fuels . Most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants . We're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power .
Can you just tell me ?
The election is this Tuesday .
Are you serious ?
I ' m not kidding .
It ' s a good thing I asked you .
That should ' Ve been something you knew already .
I couldn ' t remember .
Whatever . Just make sure you go vote .
true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .
definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .
the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken .
is that inflation ?
inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation .
has the government taken some measures to curb it ?
yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .
but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .
you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .
how ?
for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense .
sounds a good idea .
Keep your voice down . We'll talk more later . Right now I need to see Vince .
We definitely have to talk , Zina . And watch your back . Elvin is still mad about his nose .
OK , but don't tell anyone what I said .
Well , that's fine .
Yes ...
Can I have my $ 200 please ?
Sure . Here you are , $ 200 , Thank you , please come again ! Now it ' s my turn to roll the dice .
Do you have any work experience in promotion ?
Yes , I do . I have worked as a salesman for P & G Company Ltd .
Do people respond well to you ?
Yes , I'm good with people .
Thank you very much .
You'd look before you leap .
Thanks for your concern .
You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
But I don ' t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .
I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
Of course . The fitting room is right over there .
Do you have a medium in the same color ? This one is a little tight .
l'm sorry . All the black of that size are sold out . Would you like a red one ?
OK . Let me try it on . What do you think ?
Oh , that suits you very well . Besides it is believed in China that the red color brings happiness and good luck .
Really ? I'II take it and I'm leaving here tomorrow . Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you get it in ?
Our pleasure . Please fill out this form , leaving your address and telephone number .
Thanks . How much would that come to ?
Let me see ...
OK , that shall be arranged .
I didn't know I needed change .
The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar .
Where do I put the change ?
The quarters go into the slot . You have to push the slot in , and the machine will turn on .
Is that everything that I have to do ?
That's all there is .
I appreciate you helping me with this .
If you need anything else , just let me know .
I ' d like to know more about it .
Can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o ' clock ?
OK . I will be there .
Thank you for calling . Goodbye .
Bye .
Is there any special brand you would like ?
Could I have look at that pair of canvas shoes ? They look nice .
I don't know . I just need to try it once . I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight .
You should try swimming then . It helps you to keep fit .
Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them .
It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one .
But it's really exciting .
Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one .
Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror .
Yep .
I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind .
Maybe . After all , I am grown up now .
But your health is more important . Believe me !
F . Y . I . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you're done ...
Ha ! I'm just warming up ! Please take me there now !
That's right . It's over there .
I see , sir . This one is very good .
Is it ?
You may rest assured . It sells well .
May I have a look at the introduction ?
Certainly . Here it is .
I ran my car into a tree yesterday and need to miss a few days of school .
Oh , my God ! I hope you are all right .
I have a concussion , but I will be OK .
How much school will you miss ?
I only need to take this week off .
I appreciate you calling and telling me that you won ' t be in class . See you next week !
exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ...
yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies !
why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .
are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ?
never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ?
yeah , I think so .
ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great .
wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases .
A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart , and it ' s messing up the room .
But it makes the place feel so much like Christmas . I ' d really hate to have to take it down .
But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ' s been there only because we ' Ve been too busy to get rid of it .
I know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away .
But it ' s falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches .
I know , I know . But it reminds me of the great Christmas we just had . All of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted .
Yeah , it was a good Christmas . It won ' t always be this good , but we can ' t make it last longer than it should .
Ok , fine . We need to take down the tree .
I ' ll make a deal with you . We ' ll leave it up until Sunday , and then we ' ll take it down after church .
I knew you'd see it my way .
Sir , I deleted the $ 10 , but I had to add a $ 2 service charge to your bill .
Am I in the Twilight Zone ? You're charging me for a movie I never saw ?
Please don't blame me , sir . Blame the computer programmer .
This is highway robbery . I've got a good mind to call the police !
If it makes you feel any better , other guests feel the same way .
Can I get you anything to drink ? :
Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea .
Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
Thank you .
Yes . We come at the right time .
Look . Here are the core classes . Everyone has to take them .
So I don't have to worry about them .
You're catching on ! However , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ...
I'll take home economics .
Good . Now you can pick classes by yourself .
For example ?
Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .
No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .
My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .
I think it should be casual .
I agree . Next , we have to decide on food . We have a choice of Chinese or Continental Cuisine . Which one should we have ?
I would prefer Chinese food for this party .
Perfect choice . For music , should we have a live band or a DJ ?
I think we should hire a live band .
OK then . Well , I will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on Friday .
Oh , yes . I had a look yesterday . I found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I ' Ve gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I ' Ve got some idea of your exports . I ' m interested in your silk blouses .
Our silk is known for its good quality . It is one of our trade - trional exports . Silk blouses are brightly colored and beau - fully designed . They ' Ve met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand .
She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see .
I wasn't happy with it .
Nothing is to your satisfaction .
Oops , cancel that . Change the second call to 7 thirty will you , please ?
No sooner said than done . Can I help you with anything else ?
No , that's about it for now . Thanks .
Okay , sir . Have a pleasant evening .
they're also one of the richest couples . They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want .
I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars .
did either one of them win an Oscar this year ?
I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything .
Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?
yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous .
I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .
people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated .
I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .
that's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go .
thank goodness we're not rich and famous !
being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich .
Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere .
I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation .
A shouting match ? You ' re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ' t believe it .
I am not exaggerating at all . I ' m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time .
Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ' t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ' s quite natural to us .
Yes , absolutely true .
What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ?
I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market .
What was the most important thing you have learned at work ?
The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success . If I want to make in marking in advertising industry , I can ' t stop studying and creating .
Guangzhou . I've got a cousin there .
I've been packed for a week . All my stuff is in this backpack .
Let me see ... two books ... birdseed ?
That's trail mix !
Same difference . What's this ?
Would you bring the message to my room .
I'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment .
Then I'll come down and pick up the message immediately .
OK , we wait for you .
Yes . Could you tell many balance ? Here's account number .
What about the registration procedure ? Is that complicated ?
Not at all . You just need to provide your name , address , e-mail address , phone number and bank or credit card information . I will help you with that .
It is so nice of you .
What can I do for you ?
I am looking for an article in a newspaper .
Did you check the periodicals ?
I didn ' t even bother to think of that .
I ' ll show you where to find your article .
I get lost in this library .
It ' s right this way .
Thanks a lot for your help .
Don't you think it's too bloody ?
On the contrary , very exciting .
It's too small for me to wear .
Would you like another bigger one ?
No thanks . I want to have a refund .
OK , here is your money .
How about summer ?
I dislike it most .
Why ?
Because the hottest season is summer in a year .
But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
You're a very good player
Not really , but once I won a prize .
So did I . I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners .
My prize was for the best player in the country . Now let's start playing chess seriously .
How ?
Because I won't let it fail .
But what about tomorrow ? What if Stars . com decides to go with WebTracker , and not us ?
Your total comes to $ 7 .
Here's a twenty . Could you give me some more napkins ?
Sure . Your cash back is $ 13 . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes .
Thanks .
First of all , we'll design a custom-made work-out plan according to your habits .
How can you get that done ?
Well , we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified . And he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan for your needs .
What else ?
Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal .
Sounds pretty good . What about the charge ?
That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year .
Maybe one month . Just have a try first . Not too tough at the beginning .
Wise decision . You'll find it's totally worth it .
That's right . Then you will follow the signs to Gate 85 .
Thank you . You ' Ve been very helpful .
My parents are taking me to dinner tonight .
Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ?
What movie did you want to see ?
There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer .
I was thinking that I would like to see " The Secret Life of Bees . "
Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to !
Sorry , but I've gotta run . Enjoy your food , and ring the service button if you need anything else !
I like playing cards . I ' m pretty good at poker . Do you play cards ?
I ' m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling , like poker . If I did , I ' d lose all my money .
Do you play bridge ?
Yes , I do . It ' s hard to find four players though , so I don ' t play very often . Do you know anyone who plays ? If so , we could set up a game .
I can play quite well . I have a friend who likes playing , but she ' s not very good at it . Shall I invite her to play ?
Sure , I have a friend who play fairly well . We should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game .
I ' ll call my friend now . you call yours .
Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you .
You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ?
I think he might . You'd better go to his office .
You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic .
Good luck !
Let me examine you . Don't worry . It's nothing serious .
Do you think I should lie in bed ?
Yes , stay in bed and drink a lot of water . Your fever will be gone in a day or two .
OK . Do you think I can play football tomorrow ?
Of course not . You need a good rest .
OK , I'll listen to you .
That's the Forbidden city on the north of Gate building .
All the sightseeing in china is very attractive and crescive . travelling to China is very worth one . thank you so much for your guides , and I'll miss you .
That's great , bring me a bottle of that please .
I don't know what we need .
Why don't you go and check the refrigerator ?
I would appreciate it if you would do that for me .
Why don't you just get the basics ?
What do you mean ?
Eggs , milk , bread . Things like that .
Go make that list .
Sure , no problem .
No , in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . I work five days a week .
Do you enjoy work here ?
It is hard to say . But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant . Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy .
Take it easy . I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job .
Luckily not . The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss .
Glad to hear that .
Doctors aren't sure yet . But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .
You need a babysitter .
Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight . Maybe even for two nights .
I could have Suzy stay at my place .
I don't want to do that to you , Karen .
Why not ?
Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .
I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston . She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .
I'd like to talk with her . This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .
I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .
I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it . But I'd rather have someone a little older .
I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .
Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .
Just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem .
Did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ?
Everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago .
Are you going to be home so I can come by and take a look at the problem ?
I am not sure if I will be home later .
I will be coming by around 10 this morning . If you aren ' t there , I ' ll just use my key .
All right !
Here comes Jordan , though .
Wow , Michael Jordan ' s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch .
Yeah . He ' s older , so he doesn ' t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ' s still amazing .
Which team do you think will win ?
The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has .
Here's my name card .
And here's mine .
It's nice to finally meet you .
And I'm glad to meet you , too .
That's all . Have a nice stay here .
Thank you . Please get some soap for us .
Just a moment . I will do it right now .
OK .
That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ' s eight time zones east of Greenwich !
That ' s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ' s like we went back in time !
No . It's Mike's Sporting Goods .
Oh , sorry . Do you know the number for a car store , then ?
No . I don't . I suggest you look in the phone book .
I'm sorry to have bothered you .
No problem .
You need to know the type of shoes you want .
Don ' t worry about that . I can point it out in the store .
The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . In girls shoes , the heel can be high or low .
Let me write all that down . I ' m going shopping this afternoon .
Weren't you taught that yellow means slow down , not speed up ?
I did learn that .
So , then why did you speed up ?
I don't know what to tell you .
I'm going to have to write you a ticket .
I understand .
Here you go . Don't do that again .
But our credit card saves you 10 percent .
That's a nice discount .
Here . Let me give you an application form .
Thank you , but I'm just browsing today .
Okay . Enjoy your browsing .
Then tell me something about your background .
My major was computer science when I was at college , and I am quite familiar with Visual C + + and Java language .
Well , what do you think about the development in computers ?
The developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software . In some regions , the hardware is completely replaced by software . So I think the software industry has a great future .
Have you ever designed any programs concerning network ?
Yes , I have designed some programs for the network with Visual C + + and I have passed the test for programmers - MUSE .
Have you got anything to ask me ?
Yes , can you tell me what's my responsibility in this position ?
Yes , of course . You would be responsible for the development of software products .
I see . This is my advantage .
Good . Have you got any other questions ?
No .
Ok , I will contact you in a week . See you .
Thank you , bye-bye .
That's basically what I eat .
Why aren't you eating anything else ?
Well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy .
And the chicken ?
It's really healthy to eat when you bake it .
I guess that does sound a lot healthier .
Can I pay with traveller's cheques ?
Certainly . May I have your passport , please ?
Here you are .
Could you sign each cheque here for me ?
Sure .
Here are your receipt and your change , sir . Thank you .
Thank you . Goodbye .
Yeah ? Can I take a look at the Sirs you carry ?
Sure thing , follow me . This here is the .
The Canon Eos . Yeah it ' s ok , but I ' m looking for something that performs better in low light , has a better display panel , and longer battery life .
Oh , ah , um the Nikon D60 is a nice option .
Yeah , but what kit lens does this camera come with ? I don ' t want some bulky telephoto lens .
Oh , well this one has the , uh .
Looks to me like an 18-55 mm lens . pretty standard , that will do . Not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything !
So , ahem , can I interest you in any acc ...
Accessories ? Do you carry polarizing filters ?
Polarizing filter um we should ! I ' m sorry , ma ' am . It looks like we ' re sold out .
No you ' re not ! There are some right here !
Oh , well , would you look at that ! Polarizing filters .
Thanks for your help , Ralph !
No problem , ma ' am .
You're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ...
I will . Don't worry !
Air tickets ?
Yes . We will fly to Paris the day after tomorrow .
We ? The day after tomorrow ? What are you talking about ?
Today is June 18 , isn ' t it ?
Yes . So ?
Think about it !
Then it is June 20 the day after tomorrow .
Yes . Think about it carefully .
Oh , come on . Tell me please . Why did you book tickets to Paris ?
Oh , honey ! Don ' t you remember this important day to us ?
Sorry .
It is our 10th wedding anniversary this June 20 .
Our 10th wedding anniversary ?
Of course . You completely forgot it .
Darling . I think you have made a mistake .
I have made a mistake ?
Yes . We married on July 20 ten years ago .
July 20 ? But I think it should be June 20 .
Yes . We had planned to marry on June 20 , but something happened , so we had to put off our wedding day .
Yes . I remember now . We put it off . I did make a mistake . But how shall we deal with the tickets ?
Since you have booked . Then let ' s celebrate our wedding anniversary before hand .
Where shall we sit ?
How about there ?
When should I take them ?
Take on after each meal .
How long should I continue taking them ?
Take them for two days . If your symptoms persist for more than two days , you should see a doctor Also , be sure to drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration .
Thank you for your advice .
It's a long story . In a word , I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up .
What are you going to do now ?
I am trying to find a job asap . Lily doesn't know yet . I didn't tell her . I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought I went to work as usual .
That's not the way to solve the problem . Did you look in the classified advertisements column ?
Yes , I did . But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in .
Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand .
I just don't know how to bring it up . Well , all right . She has the right to know anyways .
Two stops after this one .
Could you please tell me when we get there ?
Sure .
By the way , do I need a transfer again after No . 50 ?
No , a No . 50 will take you right there .
Thank you .
It's my rock bottom price . Take it or leave it .
This is our counter-offer .
We are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great .
So are we . Our counter-offer is in line with the world market .
How about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ?
Agreed .
Sure . I ' ll also take some silver cuff link and a pair of silk ties .
Very good . Now , if you will accompany me , we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts .
That sounds good . But I have a proposal now .
What's the proposal ?
Both of our two parties were involved in the discussion previously . Shall we also allow some of our clients to join us ?
Good idea ! In this way , our clients ' needs will be met and disagreements between the two parties avoided .
Sounds like we have the same idea .
OK . I'll be happy to join you .
See you !
I bought this coat . Do you like it ?
Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ?
At the mall on 5th street .
Was it expensive ?
No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars .
That's cheap .
I know . It was a really good deal .
I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately .
I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad .
Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner .
Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already .
What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ?
The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same .
I see . I think I ' d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .
Our monthly interest is 1 . 5 % of the outstanding balance . Would you please fill out the application the form ?
What did you do ?
I didn't do anything . Finally , he left . But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .
Did he leave when you left ?
Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .
What did you do ?
Oh , I hate Channel 5 . I'd rather just listen to the radio .
Don't make such a fuss . I'm sure you will like today's programme .
What's on today ?
A basketball match between Chinese team and American team .
Really ? I'm interested in it .
It might begin now .
We moved here when I was fourteen .
Did you go to school here ?
Well , I went to high school here , but I went to college in Texas .
Did you get a job right after graduation ?
No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France .
When was that ?
Let's see ... That was about six years ago .
I bet that was interesting . What did you do there ?
I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me . How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ?
It doesn't work .
What happened ?
I don't know .
Did you call the repairman ?
Of course .
When is he coming ?
He's busy . He said next week .
You should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .
What was your major in school ?
I majored in Public Relations .
Have you done any work in this field ?
Yes , after my graduation , I worked in a trade company in Macao for one year .
What section did you work in ?
The export Business Section .
So you must be very familiar with export procedures .
Yes , very much .
That's good .
Well , I am telling you now .
Yes , but you might have told me before .
I didn't think you would be interested .
You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?
Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .
Oh , you men ! You are all the same .
Hikers tell me that the cream is best because it stays on longer .
Is there anything else I can do to help with the itching ?
You can take an antihistamine .
Thank you so much for all of the information .
You are welcome . Please feel free to ask me a question any time you need help .
tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ?
perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank .
no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .
we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning .
great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain .
no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week .
Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us .
The best way to reach him is by cell phone . I'll give you his number .
Thanks . And could I have his e-mail , just in case I can't get him by phone ?
Sure . His cell phone is 09112223 33 . And his e-mail is lower case t , smith--that's one word , at , c , c , w , dot , com , dot , t , w .
Thank you so much . Does he read his e-mails daily ?
Yes . He usually replies immediately .
Great . Thanks again . You've been very helpful .
My pleasure . I hope you get a hold of him .
Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ?
Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike .
Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city .
Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest .
Well , bring him along too . We ' ll have a great time this weekend .
Thanks , I ' ll ask him .
Please ask her to call John .
I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself I think . A friend in need is a friend in deed . The more really close friends I have , the better .
What kind of people do you like to work with ?
People who are honest , dedicated to their work and having integrity .
Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ?
That sucks .
If he wasn't so lazy , I think I wouldn't have any complaints . He mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ?
That's crossing the line .
Oh well . I'll have to live with it . What else can I do ?
Yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about .
How will I know what the numbers mean ?
You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range .
How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ?
We put all of your test results up in the same place . Just check the dates for what you need .
Ok , the mirror is over there .
Yes , I believe there are green teas , black teas and scented teas . Any Others ?
Well , have you ever heard of Oulong tea and compressed tea ?
Oh , yeah . Oulong tea is good for one's health . isn't it ?
You surely know a lot about Chinese tea .
Sure , I like drinking tea at teahouses .
Oh , so do I .
Why don't we go for one now ?
Great . We can chat while enjoying a cup there .
Let's go !
I like Business Management , and i think it's very useful for the present work .
What do you think is the relationship between the subjects you've taken and the job you are seeking ?
I've taken courses on office administration , reports and correspondence writing . I think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager , because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
I heard Chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure .
It depends . It's true that you can take some for prevention .
I'm Du Juan , in Room 312 .
I see . Wait in the room , please .
Thank you for your kindness .
Will it be an all day event ?
Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library .
That was quick thinking .
That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games .
Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you .
My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you .
OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool .
Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that .
That's basically it .
How do you stick to only those foods ?
Actually , fruits and veggies are really good for you .
Yeah , I know , but what about the chicken ?
I mainly eat baked chicken , because there's not a lot of fat .
That does sound pretty good .
I know it does , and that's because it is .
Now press this button .
Oh , and it's out of paper . Do you have any more ?
Just a second . I'll go get some .
Is that right ?
But I'm open to new things . I'll have a bowl of cereal , too .
With cold milk ?
With cold milk !
Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop .
There . Stop !
And what is more , in traditional Chinese thinking , cranes and pine trees symbolize longevity .
Thank you .
Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together .
Yes . I remember . But we never used to argue . You used to think I was wonderful . Where are you going ?
Back to live with my parents . That's something else I used to do before we were married . Remember ?
Yes , that's what I am looking for . I will take the room for 2 days .
I really love how rain clears the air .
Me too . It always smells so fresh after it rains .
Yes , but I love the night air after it rains .
Really ? Why is that ?
Because you can see the stars perfectly .
I really hope it rains today .
Yeah , me too .
I also want to pack up my package . This is the notes .
Let me see . En .. just a minute . Here it is . I need your signature on this note .
Oh , one more thing , where can I mail this letter ?
Drop it in the mail box mark out of town . at that corner .
Thank you very much .
You ' re welcome .
sure . How many would you like ?
I need 30 for my Christmas cards .
are you sending them abroad ?
twenty of them are going abroad to China and America .
do you have any going anywhere in the EU ? If you do , those are less expensive .
no .
ok , here you go . That will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence .
and the bubble wrap ?
that ' s another quid .
thanks a lot . You ' Ve been very helpful .
OK , so here ' s the plan ; When we land , run to gate 14 !
I ' m be right behind ya !
Yes . What about you ?
I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .
Pop music doesn't have any depth for me .
Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it .
Did you always like pop music .
I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music .
I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life .
oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play .
Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy .
Ok .
It's kind of you to meet me at the airport .
Welcome to Beijing . Is this your first time in China ?
No , I have visited China several times , but it's my first visit to Beijing and I think it's a great honor to be invited to your beautiful city .
It's our pleasure to have you here . I hope you will have a pleasant stay here .
Thank you . I'm sure I will have a wonderful time here .
Yes , in most circumstances .
Are you available for travel ?
Yes , I like travelling . I am young , and unmarried . It ' s no problem for me to travel frequently .
Paris in the Spring .
Oh , I ' Ve already seen it . I saw it on television last year . It ' s an old film , but it ' s very good .
Paris is a beautiful city . I have never been there . Have you ever been there , Ken ?
Yes , I have . I was there in April .
Paris in the spring , eh ?
It was spring , but the weather was awful . It rained all the time .
Just like dear old London !
My brother , here , this is an invitation letter from him . I will stay with him and his family in their home .
Alright , tell me about the ties you have to your home country .
Well , I own a house . actually , I ' m leaving my dog there with my neighbors . I have a car at home , and oh , my job ! I ' m employed by Tornal as an engineer . Actually , I only have three weeks ' vacation , so I have to go back to work at the end of March .
And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ?
Well , I do have assets in my country . like I said , I own a house , and see , here ' s a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance .
I ' m sorry , sir , we cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time , instead , you are granted a resident visa ! Congratulations , you are the millionth person to apply for a visa ! You win ! Congratulations !
I'm not , I am a vegan .
A what ?
A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood .
Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough !
It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult .
Yes , I think I should have jumped in any case .
Yeah . It's pretty exciting to be here .
Have fun while it lasts . The excitement wears off real quick . Especially after you see how much homework you get . Where are you from ?
I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here .
I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea .
Why were you in Japan ?
My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures .
That's pretty cool .
I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents .
Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around .
Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class .
Ok .
Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ?
You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down .
Ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting .
Zach , what's that on your arm ?
I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing .
It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ?
Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .
I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go .
Shouldn't we make an appointment first ?
We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse .
Whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting !
Well . It doesn't go with your skirt . I think the color itself is fine though .
Did you lend him a lot of money ?
Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back .
Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ' s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ?
No , we didn ' t . I guess you ' re right . We should patch things up .
Of course you should . You wouldn ' t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ?
Goodbye . Thank you again for coming .
Oh , that ' s great . Thanks Grace . Can you give me her number ? I ' ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow . Maybe this way I won ' t be so tired every day , and Dan and I might even get to go
I don ' t know anything for certain . We always do a double check if there is a question .
I want to see you right away .
You can come in this afternoon . If you are feeling too stressed , feel free to bring a friend along .
I know for sure that something is wrong !
Don ' t worry about a thing ; we are just taking a second look and talking .
Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss . Parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ?
Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www . taobao . com or www . ebay . com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place .
Is the service charged ?
No . it's free .
Really . I'll get a computer at once .
China beat Brazil three to zero .
Wonderful .
I think everyone has the right to love who they want .
Would you legalize gay marriage ?
Yes , I would .
Many people won ' t like that .
I ' m sure they won ' t , but that ' s my view on gay marriage .
I really like you .
I really appreciate that .
I'll just go and check it for you , sir .
I'm sorry , dad . But I would rather stay at school than go to cram school .
Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes .
What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ?
You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice .
So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ?
I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it .
Are you sure he really got the message ?
Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English .
That's hilarious ! What did he say ?
He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good .
I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again .
It is RIB 10 yuan initially and 2 yuan for each kilometer .
I have a lot of luggage . Will those fit in the taxi ?
Take it easy . I'll send a larger to pick you up .
Thank you very much .
Of course ! Everything at Helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn't you shop around ?
I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive .
Not yet , but I have to soon . He's eating me out of house and home . I caught him reading the fridge again last night
Ahahah , Maybe that will help you lose weight .
This is no laughing matter , Nick .
Sorry Paul . I couldn't help it . So why doesn't he give you a hand ?
He watch the tob too much . Now really I don't know . But I can't handle this much longer .
Well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , OK ?
That's a problem .
OK . What about going to the movies on Friday night ?
What were you planning on seeing ?
I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer .
How about " The Secret Life of Bees " ?
That's a chick flick !
Good , happy birthday to you !
Not so soon . It ' s not my birthday today . Well , you ' ll come , won ' t you ?
Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me .
My pleasure .
The Computer Center is on the first floor of the library .
Where is the library ?
The library is next to the Adminstration Building . The Adminstration Building is over there near the school ' s main entrance . There are school maps for free in the lobby of the Admin .
Thank you . I will go get one .
Sure . Glad to be of service . By the way , my name is Mike Sullivan . You will see me around a lot . I am running for President of the Student Government .
Well , hi ! My name is Eve Markowski . I am glad to meet you . With your friendly smile and helpful attitude . I am sure you will win .
Thanks you for the encouragement .
You are welcome . I ' d better go . Goodbye .
Have a good day . Bye-Bye !
Yes . I ' Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . The demand for phone cameras is growing , and Pear has been falling behind in the market .
That ' s great ! I ' m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . Is Pear still interested in having those ?
No , we ' re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
Surely . Let ' s get started by drafting a new contract .
Who invented the electric light bulb ?
That's easy . It was invented by Edison .
Correct . Now for a harder question . Who will be the first men on Mars ?
I can't answer that . But I think Mars will be visited by men before theed of this century .
Ask me a question now .
All right . What is the nearest planet to the sun ?
That's easy . It's .. er . Venus . NO . Pluto . No . Wait a minute . It's Anthe tip of my tongue . Oh dear , what is the nearest planet to the sun ?
Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men .
I believe there ' s a sitcom .
Are you interested in watching it ?
Let me look in the TV Guide first .
Oh , I am sorry . What's on Channel 2 at 10 pm ?
If I remember correctly , it's a quiz show .
Do you want to watch it ?
Let's watch it together .
Yes , of course . Excuse me . Could you possibly let us see your menu ? Oh . They haven't got one either .
But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you .
We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies .
I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free .
Cute ? Hope so .
Oh , it is coming to us , come on , Ben , get a banana to it .
Me ? No way , keep him away from me , please .
Why are you acting so strange today ?
I've said that I've got a problem with the circus . I'm not kidding .
That's weird !
Now I'm confused again ! What is the problem ?
What am I going to do about souvenirs ?
Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs !
Yes , I've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs .
Sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items , and as a guest you get a discount .
Please ! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs .
I understand completely , sir . Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment .
Forget it . I'll see you at 11:30 am .
It is OK with me . I enjoy being busy and learning new things .
This city is full of jerks .
Rude people are everywhere .
But what can you do ?
You can yell at them .
And they will yell back at you .
Yelling doesn't do any good .
No . The best thing to do is just stay home .
It depends on what you want . Do you want a one - or two-bedroom apartment ?
I just need a one-bedroom apartment .
That will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month .
Would you come with me to look at apartments ?
I would be happy to look at apartments with you .
Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it .
He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
Let's hope so .
Hmm , I guess on the 28th .
Okay , you're booked on American Airlines flight 710 , departing JFK at 6
Sounds good . Thanks a lot .
We like to get together , chat and enjoy beautiful music .
That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day .
But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope .
Here it is .
What are the charges you ' re referring to ?
The last four charges on the page .
I ' m afraid we ' re going to have to investigate these charges .
How long will an investigation take ?
I honestly don ' t know , but we will freeze payment on these charges .
That sounds absolutely fantastic .
Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this .
No problem . I'll wait for your call .
What happens if I use up my sick days before the end of the year ? If I ' m sick an extra day or two , will my pay be deducted ?
Yes . That's the company policy .
It was the same as the last place I worked at . I was hoping you ' d be different .
I ' m sure you ' ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country .
I ' m sure I will .
Have a nice journey , Lily .
Thank you , David .
I want to buy a V-neck checked sweater , and it should be tight .
Oh , I see . How about the color ?
Quiet color .
I know a shop selling this kind of sweaters .
Really ? Let ' s go there .
From Video TV .
Yes , Video TV .
Tell him I telephoned . I'd like to see him about the videotapes . Can he call me this afternoon ?
Yes , Of course . What's your telephone number ?
It's , area code 413 , 447-9626 .
That is 413-447-9662 ?
No , that's 447-9626 .
Oh , I'm sorry , 447-9626 .
Yes , that's right . Extension 162 .
Extension 162 . Okay , Mr . Suzuki . I'll give him the message .
Thank you . Good-bye .
Good-bye .
Is it expensive ?
It is the most expensive .
Well , I don't want it then . Can I move to another pump ?
Yes , I can give you regular unleaded . But you have to back up the car a little .
Give me regular unleaded then . I will back up . Can you wash my windows for me ?
I'm sorry , sir . This is not a full service gas station . I will help you fill the gas , but we don't wash windows here .
Really ? Well , I guess I have to get used to it .
Yes , they say I would get a big sum .
Have you discussed it with your wife ?
Yes , she leaves it to me .
As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary .
I have to think about it .
Excellent ! That sounds like a plan .
Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating .
No . thank you . I can handle it , but thanks for the offer .
Ok , I will see you then .
Great , have a good day , thanks again for the offer .
Why ? I don ' t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
They don ' t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do .
Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible .
I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries .
So do I .
What kind of pie do you want ?
I have no idea .
Do you want to know what kind of pie I like ?
Sure , what kind do you like ?
I love apple pie .
Oh , I love apple pie too .
There you go . Problem solved .
Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities .
Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable .
But by then , the technology will be outdated .
True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge .
That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable .
This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product .
I guess you get what you pay for .
No , thanks . I'll call back later .
That's fine . please call again later .
Ok , thank you . Goodbye .
I honestly didn't know .
The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .
That's good to hear .
Will you go and visit them ?
Of course I will .
I just wanted to give you the good news .
Thanks for letting me know .
I guess .
Are you even listening ? I ' m trying to have a conversation with you .
And I ' m trying to watch the game , but you ' re yapping on about your new clothes !
Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon !
Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ' s the third quarter and you ' Ve been blabbering on since the first !
Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
Oh no you didn ' t . You didn ' t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ' t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game !
It's 86 coach and 175 berths
One berth , please .
The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior .
How do you organize and plan for major projects ?
I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario . Then , I set a timetable that's realistic . What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react .
Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure .
I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks . The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me . Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed .
How do you manage your time in a typical day ?
I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value . The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week .
Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion .
I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings .
I get home pretty late , around midnight .
So what do you do , exactly ?
I'm a TV announcer . Don't you recognize me ? I do the weather report on KNT !
Gee , I'm sorry . I don't watch TV .
Oh , do you ? Good .
It's down a block on the right ; can I show you the way ?
OK , I'd love the company .
This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it .
Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others .
That makes you feel uncomfortable ?
Yeah . we never do that in a public office .
Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy .
I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding .
Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus .
Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ?
Yeah .
Oh , I'm shocked .
By the way , what kind of stores do we need to go ?
I want to buy some clothes in clothing store . When we are going back , go to the butcher's shop and buy some chicken .
Let ' s also go to the jewelry store to buy a crystal necklace . I want to buy one for you as your birthday present .
Thank you , darling .
OK . But just let me pick up a bottle of cooking wine and oil as we go by .
I don't think so . But it could've been .
Well . You can trust me this time . My sister is definitely sick . I'm just coming from the hospital . They say she might even die .
I don't buy your story . Try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ?
I'll do my best .
Just try to be a little more punctual in the future .
I'm working on it . Really !
Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ?
Well , surfing , scuba diving ...
Of course we will need proof , originals and duplicate of everything . As soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed .
Snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .
That's terrific . I can't wait to check it out .
Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?
Why not ? it's so cool .
But it will pose a risk to your health .
Pardon ?
I mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems .
Well , I didn't realize that .
I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .
Oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .
Yes , good luck , Maria .
Could I have some fruit ?
Of course . Wait for a moment , please .
Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?
Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered .
What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste .
Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag .
What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password .
It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough .
I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping .
Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .
That's a good idea .
Two suitcases and a handbag . The suitcases are blue and the shoulder bag is red .
Is there a name tag attached to them ?
Yes , there is .
We're very sorry for the delay . I'll check immediately and call you back .
Suit yourself . Don ' t forget to set the alarm clock .
it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America .
religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal .
what do you think about abortion ?
I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself .
do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?
I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children .
why not ? It's their children , too .
that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand .
that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter .
That will do . What an interesting picture ! How old is it ?
Actually it wad taken just last year , but I had a shaved head and a beard . Can you still recognize me ?
Barely . Will you be checking any luggage today ?
Yes , One suitcase . I also have a carry-on bag .
Ok . Mr . Lee , you ' re all set . Your flight leaves from gate 10 . Boarding begins at 10:30
It wasn't always like this , you know .
What do you mean ?
Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives .
You need a holiday . That's what's the matter .
Certainly , perhaps .
Not at all . Go right ahead .
What ' s this sir ?
It ' s traditional Chinese Medicine . I mix it with hot water like tea . Sorry . I forgot about it .
What are these red things sir ?
Oh no ! I forgot about those too ! Those are Chinese sausages for my Aunt Lily .
I ' m sorry sir , but you can ' t take any of this into the country . We will also have to check your carry-on . Please step this way . Don ' t ' be nervous ; we ' ll just look through it briefly and then
Yeah . I totally forgot they were due .
You will need to pay late fees on these books .
How much are the late fees ?
The fee is 25 cents every day .
I have to pay 25 cents a day ?
And that ' s for each book that is late .
That shouldn ' t be a problem .
Yes . I got the title of " Advance Worker " in 2006 .
Do you have any publications ?
Yes . I wrote a thesis entitled " On Interpersonal Relations in the Socialist Market Economy " and it was published in China Daily .
Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
What do you drink ?
Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
Please . Thank you so much for stopping .
Yeah , she's hot . Radiator's leaking . Looks like you were running her pretty hard .
That must have been just before I got the speeding ticket .
Did you have an accident recently ... Hey , wait a second ! I know this car !
You do ?
I ran into it a couple of weeks ago . What do you know ? Name's Hal .
I'm Akimbo . Nice to meet you , I guess .
Boy , I'm sure sorry about your car . Hey , Akimbo , I wonder if you'd like to make a deal ?
What kind of deal ?
I'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car .
You don't want your insurance company to pay for it ?
I'd rather not . They'll raise my rates . It'll cost me more in the long run .
If you give me cash , do you care if I don't fix the car ?
Hell , I don't care . Just don'T submit a report to your insurancecompany .
It's a deal , Hal . Thanks again for stopping to help . And thanks for smashing my car !
Yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district .
That's true .
Anyway , how was your such , Catherine ?
It was good . I brought lunch from home today .
You did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America .
Well , I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy .
I guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat .
Yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , don't you ?
You bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America .
Well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places .
Seriously ?
Yeah , it's hard to believe but true .
Sure . Thank you very much .
Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty . OK ?
Ok , see you .
See you .
Come with me , please .
You're back already . That sure was quick .
That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me .
Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . Anyway . He said it was too close to closing time .
Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway .
Okay , let's go !
Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years .
Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul .
Well . Good for him .
Yes . He is very understanding and supportive .
I am more interested in a full-time position . However , I would also consider a part-time position .
Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ?
I advised customers on financial matters . After I consulted the customer , I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis .
What is your greatest strength ?
I am an excellent communicator . People trust me and come to me for advice . One afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
What is your greatest weakness ?
I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . However , I began setting time-limits for myself .
Why do you want to work for our company ?
After following your firm's progress for the last 3 years , I am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and I would like to be a part of that team .
When can you begin ?
Immediately .
I'll use ginger , garlic scallion , hot pepper and vinegar .
Very good , need I help you ?
No , don't need , I can do myself .
Thanks . I can watch TV now .
But you must cook that dinner next time .
Okay , I'll do it next time .
Mam , another minute , could I ?
Hurry up , little boy .
Yeah , I know .
Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat .
That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ?
It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy .
I guess it does seem logical . I'll have to check it out !
Sorry , love .
What are you looking for now ?
My cigarettes .
Well , they ' re not here . They are in the dustbin .
In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ?
You should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due . If it hasn ' t been , we will still accept it .
Can I mail it in early next time so it isn ' t late ?
Actually , you cannot mail it in early , as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date .
Will my paycheck come right away now ?
Your check will arrive a little late .
It happened at my house .
Was anything stolen ?
I haven't checked yet .
Why do you think there was a break-in ?
My front window was broken .
We'll send a squad car shortly .
I'd appreciate that .
Yes . We ' Ve taken care of all of that . We decided not to get married in a church though . Neither of us is very religious .
Which hotel will the reception be held at ?
The palace hotel they ' re taking care of the catering , including the wedding cake . I ' m sure they ' ll do a good job .
Oh , yes . It ' s and excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
Yes . It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . It gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people .
I think you make the right decision .
Good idea .
Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive .
Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .
Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet .
It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ' t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available .
Thank you .
My pleasure .
Don't count on it , Babe . eBay is always full of surprises .
Well ... guess how low the bidding starts on the tennis racket ?
This is ordinary marriage life .
O . K . Well , go to google . com , and type in " Battle of Gettysburg . "
Oh wow , there are a lot of sites .
Here , try this one . It ' s a good site about Gettysburg .
Thanks .
For detailed information , however , you should read a history book .
Thanks . If I ' m interested , I ' ll go to the library .
The second day you take a four-hour city tour . In the afternoon you go on the famous boat cruise under the falls .
You haven't ? They have a lot of good stuff .
What do they have ?
They sell everything .
Well , I want Chinese food .
I've gotten chow mein from there before .
I guess we can eat there then .
Trust me , the food isn't half bad .
That's wonderful ! I like swimming .
at first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my family an
that's interesting . How often do you write a blog ?
it's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks .
got it . Are you still updating your blog ?
sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like .
good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months .
May I have a look at your passport , please ?
In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ' ll do well in those same events .
We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice .
I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total .
You are very optimistic !
That's right . I can see them in my dreams .
They come to the earth ?
No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space .
Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ?
OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings .
That means that you talk to them ? In which language ?
Of course in English , they learn English on Mars too .
Wow . Sounds fantastic !
In June .
Did you have the watch before getting the ring ?
Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch .
You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous .
Thank you so much .
What kind of watch is it ?
It's a Tag Heer .
If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ?
This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .
That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for .
Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .
The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
How are they at swimming ?
They ' re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ' s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ' re not very fast , but that ' s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
I ' d be afraid to jump from that height !
I think that these kinds haven ' t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher .
It seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further .
180 yuan , and you can get a free 8 piece gift package .
What's included in the gift package ?
Some black mascara , moisturizing orion , eye cream crystal lipstick , a two color eye shadow pack , styling hairspray , and a cosmetics bag .
Sounds not bad .
Here you are .
Why did you do that ?
I needed to get something really quick .
Where did you park at ?
At my apartment building .
Don't you have your own parking spot ?
I needed to be fast .
That was very lazy of you .
I see , well , I think I ' m more interested in a chequing account . I like to have easy access to my money .
Alright , then , with this chequing account you ' ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . Will you require overdraft protection ? There is an extra fee for that .
No , that won ' t be necessary .
In that case , I ' ll get you to fill out this paperwork . I ' ll need your social insurance number , and two pieces of government ID . If you could just sign here , and here , and here . we ' ll be all set . Would you like to make a deposit today ?
Yes , I ' d like to deposit one billion dollars .
What about other expenses ?
Let ' s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ' t spend much . Come on . Don ' t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ' t we ?
Maybe you ' re right . When do you plan to go ?
The sooner the better ! I can ' t wait !
Oh , I don ' t know where we ' re going yet .
As long as we ' re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time .
Let ' s go to Chicago . We can have lunch in Chinatown . Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field !
You have such good ideas !
Would you be able to relocate ?
I am open to relocating .
What are your annual salary requirements ?
I need at least 75,000 per year .
I ' ll keep that in mind . Thank you for coming in today . We ' ll be in touch .
You are welcome
Not at all .
No , make the second one with ham , pineapple and green peppers . Oh , and make it thin crust .
Okay , thin crust . Your total is $ 21 . 50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ' s free !
Perfect . Thank you . Bye ..
wait ! ! I need your address !
Yeah , you seem to like those styles .
Sure do . I get a kick out of looking punk .
This one looks really expensive though .
I don't care how much it costs . I'm rolling in it .
Lucky you ! I can't buy anything else . I'm flat broke .
I got a replace my party outfit , I trashed it last week .
Why did you drag me into this ? I've spent a week salary .
Are you on the level ? You're the one who called me , remember ?
Just joking , Tonia . I've got some wonderful clothes . Let's go and have a close look at your outfit .
Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
How much do you think the rent will be ?
I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
Yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building .
It ' s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ?
Yes , at the end of the hall .
Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ?
Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus .
Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 .
But number 13 buses leave from the center of town . You ' ll have to walk two miles to catch one .
What ? Why ? I mean , we ' Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ' re happy together , aren ' t we ?
That ' s just it , I ' m not happy anymore , Tim . It ' s not you , it ' s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
So , what are you saying ? You ' re breaking up with me because I ' m perfect ?
Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ' ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ' d only hurt you , I know I ' d only make you cry .
Baby , come on . Don ' t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ' t leave me .
I can ' t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ' m only doing this for you . I don ' t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do .
Laura ...
Here are your keys . I ' ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ' m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ' ll always love you . Goodbye .
Don't worry , we'll soon fix them .
Good , I hope you'll make sure that it won't happen again .
I'll certainly look into that .
Thank you . Goodbye .
I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time .
Wait , will I have five insurances and one fund ?
Yes . You can also enjoy legal holidays and year-end bonus .
It sounds great !
If you need to work overtime , you will get twice the usual salary as overtime pay .
OK .
You have read the relevant terms of the contract . Do you have other questions ?
How long will the induction training be ?
About two weeks .
I see .
If you don't have other questions , just sign here .
OK .
That's nothing .
Oh no , thank you . We aren't all that thirsty .
How about a little snack then ?
No , thank you , we just ate lunch a little while ago .
Well then , how is your family ?
Everyone is doing great . My sister finally had her baby .
Is it very interesting ?
Sure . I like the writer's language , too .
If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book .
Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
That's a good idea . Let's go !
Mmm . That's what I thought too . I really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . And I always enjoy watching Pierce Brosnan .
Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ?
Not as much as last time , actually . What's the name of the American actor who was in the supporting role ?
Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . Did you like him ?
Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together , don't you think ?
I don't know . I think the woman was better . She provided a good love interest . Lucky James Bond !
Yes !
Uh , oh , sure . Well , I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising .
Well , that's kind of obvious .
Give me a break , Mr Yang .
Uh , let's keep this going , shall we ?
Yes . it is I can teach you if you like .
Thank you . I can teach you how to bowl .
Right . Let's help each other .
ok . You haven ' t seen my company car , have you ?
no . let me take a look ... it ' s longer than my car .
I think it ' s over five meters long . I can ' t remember exactly . It has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour .
wow ! That ' s fast ! I don ' t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway .
we can ' t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit .
Why do people eat rice cakes on that day ?
In order to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body .
It sounds so moving .
You ' re welcome .
I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter .
If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
This will be fine , thanks .
( Handing her a menu ) Your waiter will be here in a minute to take your order .
Thank you .
The trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
Sounds reasonable .
We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
And fruits !
Surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .
I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
Yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can also help one to keep sound physical health .
I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .
You bet it !
Oh , how awful ! Let me have a look , I'm terribly sorry . It was most thoughtless of me . Would you excuse me , please ?
Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes .
It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ?
All right . Thank you .
Just a minute , please . I won't be long . I'm sure this one is perfect . You may examine it carefully .
Oh , yes , it is . I'll take this one .
I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you .
Well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing .
Is it anything like American football ?
Not very much . It ' s something like hockey , except that you use a big ball and no stick .
I ' ll come down and watch you play some day , and see what it ' s like .
Good idea . I think you ' ll like it if you give it a chance .
Really ? That ' s unusual .
I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don ' t .
Actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . In the evening , many people watch special TV shows which celebrate national day .
519 367 8901 .
Thanks . And your name is Tony , right ?
Yes . I ' m Tony . Thank you very much .
You ' re welcome . Bye .
Bye .
I saw the Sixth Sense . I didn't know it was going to be so scary .
I remember that . It was a great movie . But it was definitely scary .
If you're not busy , do you want to come over ? I'm afraid to be alone .
Sure . I can come over . What should we do ?
How about if we watch a comedy . I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense .
Ok . I'll get ready and leave . I'll see you in about 20 minutes .
Hurry , ok . It's dark out .
Don't worry , nothings going to happen . I'll be there real soon .
Ok . See you soon .
Have you ever tried it ? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ?
It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day .
It may take less time , but I don't know about easier . Yuck .
OK . This key is too high for me .
I think it's a piece of cake for you .
OK . Let me have a try ...
Well done ! I hope I can sing as well as you one day .
Thank you . I'm sure you will .
I hope so . Thank you for saying so .
I think I ' m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ?
Mmm , well this is our I ' m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
I don ' t think that ' s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better !
I ' m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ?
Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .
Get out of my store , you jerk !
Not a chance .
Not even for an hour ?
Sorry , it ' s impossible .
How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ?
That's coincident .
Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time .
I promise I will .
You'd better .
By the way , what's the time ?
You can see the time on the meter . I have radio time , you know .
It's a quarter to 12 . Could you please drive a little faster ?
Certainly .
But you must take the design and quality into consideration . You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with .
I agree that yours are of the top .
Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ?
To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help .
Impossible . How about 5 % off ?
Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable .
I ' m afraid not . The tooth is too far gone . it'll have to be taken out .
Then I might as well have it done now .
you ' d better wait , the gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days .
well , let's get a plate of those then .
sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ?
I think I might have a dahl .
what's in a dahl ?
it's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .
that sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
ok . How about some lamb kebabs ?
that's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ?
I think I'll have a beer .
ok , shall I flag down the waitress ?
I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round .
you're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me !
what would you do without me ?
Could you tell me what the exchange rate for USD is today ?
The buying rate is 826 . 44 yuan for 100 dollars .
I want to change some Us dollars to cover my expense here .
Please go to Counter No . 2 , the foreign exchange counter . It's over there .
Thank you .
Come here , let me introduce some friends to you .
It's the 11th Avenue , Park Street .
Oh , yes . I know where it is .
Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio .
I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio .
Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line .
YES . I ' Ve lost quite a few pounds since last month .
when was the last time you have track up ?
About two month ago .
Let me take your blood pressure . You look anilic . Well , Mr . Brown . I ' m happy to say it ' s nothing serious . You just a little run down from overwork .
What am I suppose to do ?
I think you ' ll needs just vacation . Try to get out doors more . I ' ll be sure if you get more rest .
Thank you , doctor . I ' ll do what you say .
You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different .
Some are better than others . But , you shouldn't have a problem .
Are they safe ?
For the most part , yes . If you don't feel comfortable with it , then it is best not to take one at night .
All superstitious nonsense ! I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks .
Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends .
Really ?
Yes , let's go in .
It is a new park , isn't it ?
Yes , how do you know ?
I guessed it .
Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well .
Oh , how wonderful !
We have new room rates , sir . Will that be acceptable to you ?
Well , it depends on the price , of course . What is it ?
It's $ 308 a night .
I have no problem with that .
Great ! Would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking ?
Definitely nonsmoking . I can't handle that smell .
Nonsmoking . Now , is a queen-size bed okay ?
No problem .
Great , Mr . Sandals . Your reservation is confirmed . Now all I need is your phone number .
Of course ! It's area code 626-555-1739 .
Thank you so much , Mr . Sandals . We look forward to seeing you !
Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .
Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?
Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited .
He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .
And the host announced that he won it all !
Will you make some recommendation ?
Twenty .
Hum , still a student ?
Yes , I'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics .
What subjects are you studying ?
English , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy .
Have you had any working experience .
Well , I worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays .
What do you like to do in your spare time ?
I like sports very much . Besides that , I also like working on a computer in my spare time .
How are your English and computer skills ?
I have passed the CET - 4 and 6 . As far as computer is concerned I can use the computer for word processing .
Okay . Mr . Liu , we'll inform you of the results within a week .
Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new .
The wall colors totally suit the style of this house .
Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen .
I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops .
The master suite is the best . Let ' s go look at that next .
There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room .
I know that you like this house , but let ' s take a look at the others before you make up your mind .
Yeah , maybe . Thanks , anyway . Hope you guys have a great time !
But I am her brother , not her servant .
Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff .
Well , welcome to the team .
This is an especially famous one . It says " May the passing days bring you health and longevity . May this season of renewal find you basked in riches . "
That's very nice . Is it for sale ?
No . I never sell my artwork .
Really ? Then what do you do with it ?
I give it away . Here , this one is for you .
Wow ! Really ? Are you sure ? Now I'll have a lucky year !
Remember , real luck must be created ( by ) yourself , and then it cannot be given or taken away ...
How much is the excess baggage part charge ?
Twenty-two dollars
Here you are .
This is your voucher , and you can get your luggage back on this . Have a good trip !
Thank you !
Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ' t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ...
Sure . Do you want it to be registered ?
Yes , I think so . There are some pictures in it . It would be a great pity if they were lost .
Yes , I will be glad to mail your letter .
Thanks .
you are welcome .
Wait ! Don't go just yet . These bananas are pretty cheap--only 35NT for this bunch .
Now that's more like it ! Bananas have lots of potassium , too !
They're also good for your digestion ! Would you like some kiwis , too ?
Are they from Taiwan ?
They're imported from New Zealand . Four for 50NT . Nine for a hundred .
OK . I'll take four kiwis .
Yes , that ' s right .
Is there anything else , sir ?
No , that ' s all .
Good morning , sir . I ' Ve got breakfast your ordered .
Just put it on the table please .
Do you need anything else , sir ?
No , thanks . Oh , yes , could I have some juice for the mini bar ?
What kind of juice do you like sir ?
Tomato or orange juice , please .
Yes , sir . I ' ll get them for you right away . Would you please sign this bill first ? Thank you , sir .
The kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . Hide away , Yi-jun !
But it ' s Friday today . This road is always jam packed during the weekend , isn ' t it ?
Right .
Ok , go ahead .
Open your mouth and show me your tongue . Say ah ... You have a bad cold . So you must stay in bed for a week .
About three years .
Can you speak any other languages ?
I'm afraid not .
I'm trying to get my license .
You need six hours .
Can I do all six hours in one day ?
You have to do it in three days .
That's all I have to do ?
That's everything .
Well , that's a relief .
Anything you like , but not too many large notes . It's useful to have smaller notes .
Here we go , Mr Waterstone . Here's your money and your interest note .
Yes , yes . Everything's fine . Thank you very much , Becky .
Six thirty , tonight .
Oh , I ' m sorry I can ' t because I have to do some housework . You can ask Jenny to go with you
All right . Maybe next time I can go with you . Bye !
Good bye !
OK , thanks for checking . Could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ?
No problem . I'll be in touch as soon as it comes in .
Now with video rentals it's all a personal matter .
Yea , I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either .
Now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't .
Go ahead .
Is there a mirror around here ?
Right over there .
Does it suit me ?
Yes , you look very nice .
How much is it ?
We're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax .
That's quite reasonable .
He can spend more time with his grandchildren .
Oh , I don't think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea !
How do you want to spend your old age ?
In the same way , probably .
How old is he ?
He is in his late thirties .
Well . I shouldn ' t have any trouble recognizing him . What time does his flight arrive ?
At 2 thirty .
That ' s all right .
You need to print your name on this list .
Okay . Now what ?
Once a computer is available , I will let you know .
How am I supposed to log on to the computer ?
All you do is type in the number on the back of your card .
That ' s it ? Thank you very much .
Why not ?
You have to make an appointment first .
Oh , okay . Can I do that right now ?
Is this Friday okay ?
Is 6 o ' clock Friday evening okay ?
Yes , I will schedule you for that time .
Thank you very much . See you then .
Let me have a soda .
What kind of soda would you like ?
May I have a Sprite , please ?
Sure , no problem .
I would also like a bag of chips .
Will that be all ?
That's everything .
I wrote the check out for way too much .
How much ?
I wrote the check out for $ 150 .
What were you supposed to write it out for ?
I was supposed to write the check out for $ 100 .
I ' ll just cancel it for you right now .
That ' s great . You ' re a lifesaver .
Oh yes and try lots of new food too .
Great . Make sure you buy me a souvenir !
Oh , don ' t worry , I will !
I'll have another cup of beer insist . I know I don't like to drink alone , especially there are someone sitting there next to me .
Come on , it's the weekend . Let's taste and enjoy this meal . Cheers !
Bottom's up , and you're right . This meal is incredible . I wish I had known this restaurant before . Thanks for bringing me here . I know I'll be back agile soon .
Have I got a high fever ?
Yes , thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ?
Yes , I have .
Now , let me have a look at you . I'd like to listen to your chest . Now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it Cough , now again . I want to examine your throat , too . Open wide , say ' Ah - - '
Aaaaahh , aaaaahh .
Yes , it does look a bit sore . Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests .
All right , thanks .
The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection .
What shall I do today ?
I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . Take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . Drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . Here's the prescription .
Exactly . How much do you want for them ?
They're only three thousand yuan .
What is this setting made of ?
Well , it's specially made of a platinum alloy , sir , and the lustre will never fade out .
I'II take them . Please wrap them up tor me and give me the receipt .
You've made an excellent choice , sir .
That's crazy .
yeah , Jenny and I got married right after graduation . It was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . I was supporting us both while she continued her studies . But now things are getting better
oh , that sounds wonderful . I have always known you two would make it . I hope I can keep in better contact with you guys . I don't want us to drift apart again .
definitely ! Actually , we just moved into a new place . There's a house-warming party this Saturday , if you are free ? I know Jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party .
sounds great ! I'll be there .
Oh , you mean Canal Street ?
That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown .
Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ?
At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ?
I cannot get hold of her yet .
See you around , Carl .
See you later .
You'd better pay more attention to your health .
I will , thanks for your concern .
You're welcome .
Can I spy on you guys from the window ?
No . But I'll fill you in later . Right now I have to find Vince .
we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking .
that ' s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ?
that ' s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle .
I didn ' t realize that speaking in class could be so easy .
the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ' t be sure how .
Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list .
How many people are on the waiting list right now ?
Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list . And you are number 176 .
Yes .
What's the weather like in your country ?
Mm ... It's quite warm now .
Where do you live ?
In London . Where do you live ?
Here . Near this school .
I think so . We can go there in the afternoon if you like .
It ' s a special kind of Chinese herb . It ' s good for you !
Oh , I nearly forgot the exams .
You do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . Am I right ?
Yeah , I guess so . Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow .
An excellent idea . Work now and play later .
I know you're right . School is more important than TV . Can I watch one more show , then go to bed .
No , now it's bedtime .
Thank you .
No problem .
I'm sorry , Ms . Jenkins is away from her desk . She has already left for lunch . Would you like to leave a message for her ?
What other sources of energy do you use ?
We don't use any fossil fuels . Most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants . We're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power .
The election is this Tuesday .
Are you serious ?
I ' m not kidding .
It ' s a good thing I asked you .
That should ' Ve been something you knew already .
I couldn ' t remember .
Whatever . Just make sure you go vote .
definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .
the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken .
is that inflation ?
inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation .
has the government taken some measures to curb it ?
yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .
but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .
you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .
how ?
for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense .
sounds a good idea .
We definitely have to talk , Zina . And watch your back . Elvin is still mad about his nose .
OK , but don't tell anyone what I said .
Can I have my $ 200 please ?
Sure . Here you are , $ 200 , Thank you , please come again ! Now it ' s my turn to roll the dice .
Yes , I do . I have worked as a salesman for P & G Company Ltd .
Do people respond well to you ?
Yes , I'm good with people .
Thanks for your concern .
It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
But I don ' t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .
I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
Do you have a medium in the same color ? This one is a little tight .
l'm sorry . All the black of that size are sold out . Would you like a red one ?
OK . Let me try it on . What do you think ?
Oh , that suits you very well . Besides it is believed in China that the red color brings happiness and good luck .
Really ? I'II take it and I'm leaving here tomorrow . Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you get it in ?
Our pleasure . Please fill out this form , leaving your address and telephone number .
Thanks . How much would that come to ?
Let me see ...
The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar .
Where do I put the change ?
The quarters go into the slot . You have to push the slot in , and the machine will turn on .
Is that everything that I have to do ?
That's all there is .
I appreciate you helping me with this .
If you need anything else , just let me know .
Can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o ' clock ?
OK . I will be there .
Thank you for calling . Goodbye .
Bye .
Could I have look at that pair of canvas shoes ? They look nice .
You should try swimming then . It helps you to keep fit .
It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one .
But it's really exciting .
Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one .
Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror .
Yep .
I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind .
Maybe . After all , I am grown up now .
Ha ! I'm just warming up ! Please take me there now !
Is it ?
You may rest assured . It sells well .
May I have a look at the introduction ?
Certainly . Here it is .
Oh , my God ! I hope you are all right .
I have a concussion , but I will be OK .
How much school will you miss ?
I only need to take this week off .
I appreciate you calling and telling me that you won ' t be in class . See you next week !
yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies !
why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .
are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ?
never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ?
yeah , I think so .
ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great .
wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases .
But it makes the place feel so much like Christmas . I ' d really hate to have to take it down .
But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ' s been there only because we ' Ve been too busy to get rid of it .
I know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away .
But it ' s falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches .
I know , I know . But it reminds me of the great Christmas we just had . All of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted .
Yeah , it was a good Christmas . It won ' t always be this good , but we can ' t make it last longer than it should .
Ok , fine . We need to take down the tree .
I ' ll make a deal with you . We ' ll leave it up until Sunday , and then we ' ll take it down after church .
Sir , I deleted the $ 10 , but I had to add a $ 2 service charge to your bill .
Am I in the Twilight Zone ? You're charging me for a movie I never saw ?
Please don't blame me , sir . Blame the computer programmer .
This is highway robbery . I've got a good mind to call the police !
If it makes you feel any better , other guests feel the same way .
Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea .
Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
Thank you .
So I don't have to worry about them .
You're catching on ! However , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ...
I'll take home economics .
Good . Now you can pick classes by yourself .
Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .
No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .
My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .
I agree . Next , we have to decide on food . We have a choice of Chinese or Continental Cuisine . Which one should we have ?
I would prefer Chinese food for this party .
Perfect choice . For music , should we have a live band or a DJ ?
I think we should hire a live band .
OK then . Well , I will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on Friday .
Our silk is known for its good quality . It is one of our trade - trional exports . Silk blouses are brightly colored and beau - fully designed . They ' Ve met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand .
I wasn't happy with it .
Nothing is to your satisfaction .
No sooner said than done . Can I help you with anything else ?
No , that's about it for now . Thanks .
Okay , sir . Have a pleasant evening .
I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars .
did either one of them win an Oscar this year ?
I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything .
Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?
yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous .
I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .
people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated .
I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .
that's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go .
thank goodness we're not rich and famous !
being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich .
I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation .
A shouting match ? You ' re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ' t believe it .
I am not exaggerating at all . I ' m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time .
Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ' t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ' s quite natural to us .
Yes , absolutely true .
I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market .
What was the most important thing you have learned at work ?
The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success . If I want to make in marking in advertising industry , I can ' t stop studying and creating .
Let me see ... two books ... birdseed ?
That's trail mix !
Same difference . What's this ?
I'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment .
Then I'll come down and pick up the message immediately .
OK , we wait for you .
Not at all . You just need to provide your name , address , e-mail address , phone number and bank or credit card information . I will help you with that .
It is so nice of you .
I am looking for an article in a newspaper .
Did you check the periodicals ?
I didn ' t even bother to think of that .
I ' ll show you where to find your article .
I get lost in this library .
It ' s right this way .
Thanks a lot for your help .
On the contrary , very exciting .
Would you like another bigger one ?
No thanks . I want to have a refund .
OK , here is your money .
I dislike it most .
Why ?
Because the hottest season is summer in a year .
But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
Not really , but once I won a prize .
So did I . I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners .
My prize was for the best player in the country . Now let's start playing chess seriously .
Because I won't let it fail .
But what about tomorrow ? What if Stars . com decides to go with WebTracker , and not us ?
Here's a twenty . Could you give me some more napkins ?
Sure . Your cash back is $ 13 . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes .
Thanks .
How can you get that done ?
Well , we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified . And he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan for your needs .
What else ?
Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal .
Sounds pretty good . What about the charge ?
That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year .
Maybe one month . Just have a try first . Not too tough at the beginning .
Wise decision . You'll find it's totally worth it .
Thank you . You ' Ve been very helpful .
Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ?
What movie did you want to see ?
There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer .
I was thinking that I would like to see " The Secret Life of Bees . "
Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to !
I ' m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling , like poker . If I did , I ' d lose all my money .
Do you play bridge ?
Yes , I do . It ' s hard to find four players though , so I don ' t play very often . Do you know anyone who plays ? If so , we could set up a game .
I can play quite well . I have a friend who likes playing , but she ' s not very good at it . Shall I invite her to play ?
Sure , I have a friend who play fairly well . We should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game .
I ' ll call my friend now . you call yours .
You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ?
I think he might . You'd better go to his office .
You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic .
Good luck !
Do you think I should lie in bed ?
Yes , stay in bed and drink a lot of water . Your fever will be gone in a day or two .
OK . Do you think I can play football tomorrow ?
Of course not . You need a good rest .
OK , I'll listen to you .
All the sightseeing in china is very attractive and crescive . travelling to China is very worth one . thank you so much for your guides , and I'll miss you .
Why don't you go and check the refrigerator ?
I would appreciate it if you would do that for me .
Why don't you just get the basics ?
What do you mean ?
Eggs , milk , bread . Things like that .
Go make that list .
Sure , no problem .
Do you enjoy work here ?
It is hard to say . But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant . Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy .
Take it easy . I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job .
Luckily not . The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss .
Glad to hear that .
You need a babysitter .
Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight . Maybe even for two nights .
I could have Suzy stay at my place .
I don't want to do that to you , Karen .
Why not ?
Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .
I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston . She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .
I'd like to talk with her . This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .
I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .
I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it . But I'd rather have someone a little older .
I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .
Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .
Did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ?
Everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago .
Are you going to be home so I can come by and take a look at the problem ?
I am not sure if I will be home later .
I will be coming by around 10 this morning . If you aren ' t there , I ' ll just use my key .
Here comes Jordan , though .
Wow , Michael Jordan ' s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch .
Yeah . He ' s older , so he doesn ' t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ' s still amazing .
Which team do you think will win ?
The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has .
And here's mine .
It's nice to finally meet you .
And I'm glad to meet you , too .
Thank you . Please get some soap for us .
Just a moment . I will do it right now .
That ' s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ' s like we went back in time !
